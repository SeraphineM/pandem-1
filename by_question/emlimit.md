# Austria 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The officially declared time limit for the Covid-19 Law, the main legal instrument, is 31 december 2020. Any regulations produced within the Covid-19 Law therefore ends at this date, if not having been ended earlier. The measures taken within the Covid-19 Law and Second Covid-19 Law vary a lot in terms of their time limits, whether a time limit has been set and how and how fast measures will be taken to ease restrictions. Consequently, many of the emergency measures taken under the legal instrument have earlier time limits, and the overall response also has a time limit in that the legislation is terminated at December 31, and this is therefore coded as 1.

*Comments*:
 'Because the declaration of the state of health alert was made by "an oral communication", (1) we could not find material elements of temporal limitation of this state. But according to article 66, the measures taken under this state must be limited in time. Indeed, according to article 66 (3), "compulsory hygiene and prophylaxis measures are applied during a determined period and renewable if necessary"....Materially, the declaration of health alert as announced is unlimited in its form. The declaration of the state of health alert should be limited in time, which would ensure a comfortable reading between the declaration and the measures taken in application of this declaration, which, meanwhile, are limited in duration with the possibility of extension.''

 Decisions by the Civil Protection Headquarters from 19 and 21 March (prohibition of gathering in public places) have a 30-day time limit. However, the decision by the Civil Protection Headquarters from 23 March (which "prohibits individuals from leaving their place of residence without a special permit, to be issued for very limited cases", "Odluka o zabrani napuštanja mjesta prebivališta i stalnog boravka u Republici Hrvatskoj") does not mention a time limit. I also did not find a time limit mentioned in press conferences or local media outlets. Moreover, an amendment to 23 March decision from 18 April explicitly mentions that "the necessary measure prohibiting leaving the place of residence and permanent residence in the Republic of Croatia shall be applied as long as there is a serious risk of transmission of COVID-19 disease, ie until this Decision is repealed. " Although the decision was lifted on 11 May 2020, emlimit is coded as 0 since there was no time limit at the time the decision was passed.

 Under Art 154 of Egypt's 2014 constitution, the president with parliamentary approval can declare a state of emergency for up to three months, with three-month extensions if approved by two-thirds of parliament. In this sense, there is an officially declared time limit. However, the current 596-member parliament is tightly controlled by intelligence agencies and dominated by the al-Sisi's supporters. It has acted largely as a rubber stamp for his policies with almost no opposition.

 The Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4). The president initially imposed restrictions on movement, gatherings, and travel for two to three weeks. He has invoked the right and extended the provisions on several occasions, most recently 15 June 2020. Presently, according to E.I. 64 of 15 March, the main emergency provisions under the restrictions act are set to expire on 31 July.

 Initially, the regulation was set to exist for three months (ending on July 29), but has since been extended one week at a time. The last extension by time of coding was made on September 18 and it is currently set to end at September 24. So while extensions have been made, the legislation has always had a time limit.

# Israel 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Article 38 of the Israeli constitution, Declaring a State of Emergency, states that the Knesset can declare a state of emergency for a maximum time limit of one year (with possibility of extension), and that the government can declare a state of emergency with the maximum time limit of 7 days (with the possiblity of extension, and the possible termination of the state of the emergency if the Knesset votes in favour of ending it). This state of emergency is the latter, declared by the government, and thus had an initial time limit of 7 days although they have extended it afterwards.
Note that since July 21, there's a new (temporary) law regulating state's of emergency that gives government extended powers during an SOE, as well as the right to declare it for a longer time. See comments and sources under emleglimit for more information.

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 In the Decree 2020-351 du 23 mars, 2020 which declared a state of emergency, it mentions that this measure may be renewed if necessary, no limit date.  
All the sources also mention that the President did not specify the duration of these new measures.
In the Law of 1969 on the state of emergency, it states that the decree declaring a state of emergency should specify its duration, but it does not do so.

In another source it mentions that ''The health alert system is maintained until the end of 2020.'', but it is unclear if that differs from the state of emergency.

*Comments*:
 Emergency situation: no time limit in the decision to declare emergency situation, 30-day time limit in the announcement by the Prime Minister on the news section of the government website. No time limit in the legal framework (the Law on Civil Protection from 24 May 2018). On 9 May the President announced that emergency situation would be extended in a speech commemorating the anniversary of the end of World War II. The announcement from 10 May by the prime minister says that the emergency regime is still in place after the state of emergency in parts of the country has ended. OSCE report (p.162) says that "emergency situation" was declared for one month, was later renewed and is in place (the report was published on 17 July). I also found no evidence that the emergency situation has ended (e.g. local media reports that it is still in place). Since the official declaration of the emergency situation has no time limit (despite it being mentioned in the press statement), I coded emlimit as 0.

State of emergency (part of the country): Chapter 2, Article 13 of the Constitution: 30 days limit for the whole country, 60 days for specific territories. Can be extended for the same period.  The state of emergency was extended and ended on 10 May 2020.

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The Constitution of Lesotho limits a state of emergency to 14 days, unless authorized by the legislature, which may allow for a period of no more than six-months. The legislature refused to approve a measure that would have extended the state of emergency beyond the initial 14 day period allowed for in the constitution. At that time, it had been suspended by the prime minister. Later the constitutional court ruled the suspension of parliament unconstitutional. It has since been reinstated and the prime minister resigned.

*Comments*:
 The Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act allows for an initial state of disaster to last for three months and to be extended for another three months. President Mutharika initially announced a 30-day period for the state of disaster. Later, on 01 April, the government invoked the Public Health Act to issue the Public Health (Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management) Rules on 08 April. However, the 21-day lockdown proposed in these rules was halted by the High Court of Malawi on 17 April 2020. We code the official end date based on the initial 30-day period for the state of disaster because we could find no evidence of its extension.

''Le décret instituant l’état d’urgence peut par une disposition expresse, conférer à l’autorité administrative compétente le pouvoir de prononcer l’internement administratif des personnes dont l’activité présente un danger pour la sécurité publique. Cette mesure peut être prononcée pour une durée maximum d’un (1) mois, renouvelable une seule fois pour une période égale.''

 The activation of article 60 of the Constitution mentions that the ordinances may be taken during a limted period of time, but the Council of Ministers did not specify the length of this period. The separate measures that were introduced all had a limit date (usually 2 weeks and renewed).

''The Council examined and approved a draft enabling law authorizing the Government, in application of article 60 of the Constitution, to take by ordinances during a limited time, all the necessary measures, which are normally of the domain of the law, to fight the Covid pandemic19.''

# Poland 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The official statement announcing the state of epidemic says the state is in force until cancellation (based on order 491 from 20 March 2020, chapter 1, point 1). I found no time limit on the duration of the state of epidemic and the emergency measures in the order declaring a state of epidemic (Order 491 from 20 March 2020, http://www.dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2020000049101.pdf). The emergency measures that apply for the duration of the state of epidemic are covid-19 related measures such as restrictions on movement (border crossing and similar) (Chapter 2), Restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing and use of certain items (masks, disinfectant and similar) (Chapter 3),  Restrictions on the functioning of certain institutions or workplaces (Chapter 4) , Prohibition of organizing shows and other gatherings of the population (Chapter 5), access to real estate, premises and areas provided for by anti-epidemic plans (Chapter 6). 

The state of epidemic was declared based on “the Act on specific solutions related to the prevention and combating COVID and other infectious diseases and crises they caused” (from 7 March 2020, http://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2020000037401.pdf), which amended “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases” (5 December 2008). According to Article 36 of the Act from 7 March, Articles 3-6 (on remote work, additional care allowance, airport regulations and procurement) and Articles 10-14 (on central government’s authority to give orders to local governments, changes to construction, tourism and transportation industries) a 180-day time limit and Article 31 (on budget transfers) has a 365-day time limit. The rest of the provisions (related to the “functioning of the health care system, telecommunication or state's Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations”, https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/poland-report-covid-19-april-2020_en.pdf) amend existing regulations and are permanent changes to the “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases”.

According to OSCE report (p.36), "the end date of certain measures is uncertain."

The state of epidemic is also different from the state of emergency that has a 90-day time limit based on the Constitution (Article 230, point 1). While some specific emergency measures under a state of epidemic have a time limit, the state of epidemic was declared until further notice, therefore coded as 0.

 Most but not all measures have a time limit. Based on Act on Intervention Measures to Contain the COVID-19 Epidemic and its Mitigation for Citizens and the Economy (ZIUZEOP) from 13 March 2020 (Art 20.2) (which introduced amendments to the Communicable Diseases Act, see emname), the end date for the epidemic is 15 May 2020, but can be extended until 31 May 2020. 
However, the decree restricting freedom of movement from 29 March 2020 had no time limit (Art.7), which was reviewed by the Constitutional Court (OSCE report. p.38). Moreover, according to European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, " On 29 May, the government adopted decision, in effect from 1 June, laying down that all adopted measures that have not been lifted by 1 June shall remain in force until they are amended or revoked, since there is still the risk of spread of the infection."

 The measures have been implemented differently in difference areas of South Korea depending on the spread of Covid-19 in different areas. The country never imposed a lockdown.

 Time limit depends on the particular measures (such as 1 August 2020, 1 September 2020), with some measures until 31 December 2020. Some measures do not have a time limit. According to IDEA, "In late April, the Tajik Prime Minister’s COVID-19 Task Force cancelled all public events indefinitely. As of September, the prohibition is still in place. " There is also no end date for the restictions on public events in the press release of the state news agency "Khovar" (no other legislation or official announcement on the President's website found).

 On 14 May 2020 A heavy fine and a shutdown threat was imposed on a TV channel RTV Ora News for violating social distances rules, which is argued to be related to the chanel's critisim of the government. Since it was a single incident and no further cases were reported, merepoth is coded as 0 in July-September 2020.

*Comments*:
 Journalist Natig Isbatov was arrested on 9 April 2020 and "jailed for allegedly violating lockdown regulations by filming a protest outside an employment office in Baku." Since 21 June 2020, new quarantine measures restricted journalists' freedom of movement since they had to obtain permissions to leave home, which likely placed restrictions on all reporting. Merepoth is therefore coded as 1 for both time periods (March-June 2020, July-September 2020).

Reports explain that the law imposes serious restrictions on freedom of expression in Bangladesh.

# Burma/Myanmar 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

*Comments*:
 Myanmar has used Article 505 of the Penal code, which states that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public" is punishable with up to two years in prison, to arrest and jail a journalist reporting on Covid-19, as well as having closed down over 200 websites by claiming that they have spread "fake news". As the regulation in use allows for any arbitrary interpretation of "fear or alarm to the public", and media outlets online are being closed down, this is deemed a de facto limitation on reporting on non-Covid-19 related news as well. This is therefore coded 1 for both periods.

*Comments*:
 1: Human Rights Watch has reported that the Cambodian authorities have been using the pandemic to carry out arbitrary arrests of opposition supporters and government critics. The Cambodian government has made at least 30 arrests from late January to April 2020. 12 of these 30 people are affiliated with the now dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).

2: The new emergency law which was passed also allows the government to ban the publication of “any information that could cause unrest, fear or disorder”. Hence, this is not limited to just Covid-19 related issues.

 The Chinese government has maintained a very tight and highly controlled media since before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Reporters without Borders have reported how China’s state owned media is currently under the close control of the Community Party. While there are foreign journalists and news agencies working in China, the encounter multiple obstacles while working in the field. More than 100 journalists are currently detained in conditions that pose a threat to their lives. In this way de-facto limitations are already in place on media reporting.

 A Congolese reporter was arrested with charges of violating Covid-19 restrictions on May 9, 2020. He was filming a broadcast - unrelated to the pandemic.

''Faustin Mbiya, a journalist at Foundation Daniel Madimba radio station based in Mbuji-Mayi, was arrested on 9 May on his return from producing a broadcast in Tshilenge, 25 km to the east. He was freed on bail of 300,000 Congolese francs (160 euros) on 12 May pending trial on charges of “violating emergency health measures” and “insulting the provincial authorities.”'' (1)
''Faustin Mbiya wa Kabeya is accused of vilifying the governor in his broadcasts. Facts that the accused rejects.'' (2)

Also, the media landscape in DRC is characterized by a plethora of ''press freedom violations ...including arrests, attacks, threats and ransacking or closures of media outlets''....''The environment for media personnel continues to be extremely hostile..''

 The emergency measures, in particular Décret n°00106/PR/MEFPTFPDS du 10 avril 2020 désignant les services et les personnels essentiels du secteur public, parapublic et privé d’astreinte pendant l’état d’urgence lié au COVID-19'' (1) (Decree n°00106 designating the essential services and personnel of the public, parapublic and private on-call sector during the state of emergency linked to COVID-19), does not include journalists and the media in the listed essential services that are exempted from the movement restrictions of the emergency measures.

Journalists and editors in Gabon report that this lack of granted authorizations poses a problem for them reporting in the field (2).

Authorities in Gabon have extended the country's State of Health Emergency measures for 45 days from Aug. 14, 2020. A nightly 2000-0500 curfew remains in effect.

In addition, the media in Gabon are facing serious government censorship (6). The role of HAC (High Authority of Communication) in particular has been extremely problematic the last years (4, 5), suspending several media and newspapers. Although these developments related to facts before Covid19, it is nevertheless a problem which relates to the current situation and still exists.

*Comments*:
 1: The government has attempted to exercise total control over information about Covid-19. On 31 March 2020, it asked the supreme court to direct the media to publish nothing about the epidemic “without first ascertaining the facts from the mechanism provided by the government.” While the courts did not allow this, the made concessions by ruling that, to avoid the dissemination of “unverified news capable of causing panic,” the media must “refer to and publish the official version about the developments” including the government’s daily bulletin.

2: In May 2020, police registered cases against six journalists in the northern Himachal Pradesh state for reporting about problems faced by migrant workers amid the COVID-19 lockdown. Some reports stated that the stranded laborers did not receive adequate help from the authorities. Police said the reports were "fake" and invoked the Disaster Management Act against the journalists.

3: In the southern Tamil Nadu state, Andrew Sam Raja Pandian, a digital journalist and founder of the SimpliCity news portal, was arrested on April 18 for publishing two news articles related to COVID-19. Pandian and his colleague, Jerald Aruldas, were held by police for reporting about the alleged government corruption amid the pandemic and how doctors faced food shortages while working during the lockdown.

Daniel Bastard, head of RSF’s Asia-Pacific desk has said that ‘In this directive, the Indonesia police are taking advantage of the need to combat disinformation linked to the Covid-19 pandemic in order to rein in journalists who might want to publish information critical of President Joko Widodo or his government

 Indepedent media were not given accreditation during the state of emergency (declared in certain territories) and were not allowed to pass policy check points, limiting their ability to report on any issues due to emergency measures. According to IPI: "Authorities in Kyrgyzstan have excluded 20 different independent media outlets from receiving special press passes which allow them exemption from lockdown rules, giving them instead only to state-run media." Since the state of emergency in certain territories ended on 10 May, merepoth is coded as 1 only in March-June 2020 period.

# Laos 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
This puts a strong de facto limitation on media reporting on non-Covid-19 related news in Laos, by making it  punishable to report on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any de facto limitations on media reporting about  Covid-19 in Lebanon,  and no other indications have been found of there having been implemented any such limitations. However, the state of emergency imposed after the Beirut explosion introduce far reaching powers for the government that could possibly limit media, and Lebanese media do face other restrictions, for example through defamation laws (an introduction of these can be found in this HRW report: https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/15/there-price-pay/criminalization-peaceful-speech-lebanon)  This is coded 0, as no evidence has been found that existing or new measures having limited reporting on non Covid-19-related news with reference to Covid-19, but it should be noted that the media seem to face limitations in other aspects.

 The Malaysian authorities have arrested journalists under Section 505 of the penal code (as well as other legislation), which bans statements causing "fear or alarm to the public". While this vague formulation could be used to prosecute journalists on non-Covid-19 related news as well, there is no reports found of that happening, and the authorities seem to only use this legislation to place de facto limitations on reporting on Covid-19 related issues as of yet. This is therefore coded as 0.

 The amendment enacted by Mongolia does make it punishable "Misleading the public or disseminating false information‚ during a crisis" but as this only seem to regard information on the crisis as such, and that no information has been found indicating that Mongolia has used this amendment to prosecute any non-Covid-19 related news reporting, this is coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 With the Emergency Laws, there are limitations in media reporting during the pandemic. This affects media reporting in general, if it is perceived by the government to ''contravene'' in any way the Decree. Also, Morocco's media face judicial harassment, and many journalists and citizen-journalists continue to be imprisoned, in light of covid19. 

''The decree enables the government to declare a ""state of health emergency"" and take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).''

In a statement on March 22, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news. (the statement is found in the link in arabic)"

 Philippines’ biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN was forced off air on 5 May 2020. The network had expected to continue broadcasting during the coronavirus lockdown. However the National Telecommunications Commission decided against renewing its 25 year franchise. Duterte has repeatedly threatened to stop ABS-CBN, and previously accused it of failing to broadcast his campaign advertisements. In a speech in December, he taunted the network, stating: “ABS-CBN, your contract is about to expire. If I were you, you’re better off selling it … I will make sure that you will remember this episode of our times for ever.”

(the protest was planned but did not take place).  Since it was two incidents and no further cases were reported, merepoth is coded as 0 in July-September 2020.

 The curfew in Senegal was implemented by quota, i.e the schedule would vary over time (see 2, 3), and the government did not manage to issue authorization for exemption from the restrictions to all journalsists and media, preventing them therefore from accessing information and reporting in the field.
The state of emergency and the related curfew -which affected media - were lifted in Senegal on June 30, 2020.

''The Ministry of the Interior was unable to issue exemptions to all the media and all the journalists who requested this document which allows them to circulate during the curfew "the distribution was made by quota" comments Bamba Kassé, the general secretary of the Senegalese journalists' union.''

 On 10 August, the Tanzanian government announced that broadcasting foreign content would be banned without government permission. This includes content about Covid-19. The government effectively controls the information that is published. However, this is not justified by any emergency response of the government, so it does not affect the score on this variable.

 1: On May 22, Bangkok police arrested prominent pro-democracy activists Anurak Jeantawanich and Tosaporn Serirak for violating the ban on public assembly – one of the emergency measures imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19. The arrest was triggered by a remembrance service they held earlier that day with supporters of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship – known as the “Red Shirts” – to mark the 6th anniversary of the 2014 military coup. 

2: Thai authorities previously arrested Anurak on the same charges on May 13, when he held a remembrance service to demand justice for those killed and wounded by the military during the crackdown on the 2010 Red Shirts protests. Even though thermal scanners to detect fevers were provided at the events and participants wore face masks, the activists were accused of ignoring social distancing, acting in a way likely to spread the virus, and disobeying lawful orders in both cases. If found guilty, they face two years in prison and a 40,000 baht (US$1,250) fine.

3: In southern Thailand, local authorities in Songkhla province denied a request by villagers in Singha Nakhon district to hold a rally on May 24 2020 in protest of the government’s plan to build beach walls and breakwaters on Muang Ngam Beach. Despite an assurance from the organizers to follow social distancing and other Covid-19 measures to keep people safe, officials prohibited the rally.

*Comments*:
 While there are de facto limitations as a consequence of or in relation to the pandemic, and many reports on journalists being charged with criminal offences for investigative reporting, no case has been found where the Turkish government or its agents have justified such acts of charging journalists for reporting on non-Covid-19 related news with any reference to the pandemic. Therefore, this is coded as 0 for both periods.

 The government is using the state of emergency to silence journalists who criticize the government. According to the Human Rights Watch: "Authorities have harassed, detained, and prosecuted political opponents, including several legislators, journalists who publish critical information, health workers who criticize the government’s handling of the pandemic (...). Security forces have also confiscated cellphones and laptops from journalists and forced them to erase photos or videos."

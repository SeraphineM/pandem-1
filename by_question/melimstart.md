 The media limitations are made under the authority of the declaration of State of Emergency (articles 85, 86, 87, and 88 of the constitution), which allows the President to "suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees" during a State of Emergency.

*Answer*: 2020-03-24 

*Comments*:
 Note that on 19 March the authorities blocked 52 websites for allegedly spreading false information during covid-19. Based on the press release, this was part of emergency measures, but I cannot verify this information since the official document with legal references is a scanned version in Romanian. Therefore, the beginning of media limitations is coded as 24 March, but it is possible that the measures were enforced earlier.

*Answer*: 2020-04-17 

*Comments*:
 A presidential proclamation on 17 April 2020 made amendments to the emergency regulations to include provisions against false reporting. A person commits an offence if that person publishes any false or misleading statements about or in connection with the covid-19. This formulation is aimed at fake news, although it is also open for abusive use.

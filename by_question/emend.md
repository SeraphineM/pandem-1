 Still in place. On July 18 began a new phase of the isolation measures, with gradual flexibilization and opening. Most provinces reduced the number of cases and have transitioned from "mandatory social isolation" to "mandatory social distancing". However, the Decree nº 297/2020 is still being implemented in some places, including the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires. Currently the measures are valid until September 20.

# Belgium 

*Answer:* *No answer entered* 

*Comments*:
 Belgium began phasing out lockdown measures at the beginning of May. There have been several key dates when measures were being gradually relaxed, but many of them there are still in place:

''Belgium's next phase of lockdown relaxation will not start as foreseen on August 1 given the current state of the coronavirus pandemic.''
''So-called Phase 5 included allowing a higher number of people to take part in events held indoor and outdoors. Currently, civil marriage ceremonies, religious gatherings and funerals for up to 200 attendees are allowed, while the limit for participation at private indoor receptions is 50 people. Outdoor events for up to 400 people are also permitted.''

28 August 2020: The Belgian government, with a nod to European Commission recommendations, is adjusting its border restrictions as it assesses the evolving COVID-19 situation in countries around the world, and is alternatively leaving certain restrictions in place and putting measures/conditions in place to allow for travel by certain categories of travellers. The government has agreed to gradually resume visa operations and activities in Belgian Embassies and Consulates abroad to facilitate certain visa applications.''

# Bosnia and Herzegovina 
*Answer*: 2020-05-31 

*Comments*:
 31 May 2020 corresponds to the end of the state of disaster in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (one of the subnational entities). In the Serb Republic the state of emergency was lifted on earlier on 21 May 2020. I have not found any documents indicating the end of the state of disaster at the federal level, but it is logical to code it as having ended since it was lifted in both subnational entities. Moreover, Federal Civil Protection Headquarters has not issued any new orders for covid-19 measures since 31 May 2020.  For example, from the OSCE report: "The Republika Srpska declared a state of emergency on the basis of Art. 70 of the Constitution as of 3 April, which ended on 21 May, while the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a state of natural or other disaster on 17 March, on the basis of the Framework Lawon Protection and Rescue of People and Material Property from Natural and Other Disasters in BiH, which ended on 31 May."

# El Salvador 
*Answer*: 2020-06-15 

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was declared on March 14 for 30 days (legislative decree n 593), extended on April 12 for 4 days (legislative decree 622), extended on April 16 for 15 days (legislative decree 631) and extended on April 30 for 15 days (legislative decree 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on May 16 for 30 days via executive decree 18, but the decree was considered unconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on May 18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree 648 from May 30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country. The president then vetoed this decree on June 6, but the legislative overcame his veto on June 11. Bukele tried to define guidelines for reopening the country via the executive decrees 31 and 32, which were not approved by the national assembly. The legislative tried to define their own guidelines via the legislative decree 661 from June 12, which Bukele also vetoed. The conflict went to the supreme court, which considered the executive decrees unconstitutional because they imposed limits to constitutional rights without legislative approval. They considered the legislative decree legal and that the president should approve it, which he did on August 31, but he didn't publish it and the dates defined in the decree had already passed. This conflict between executive and legislative left an uncertainty in the country. The supreme court annouced that the measures imposed via the executive decree 32 would be lifted on August 23 due to their uncostitutionality, and that the executive and the legislative should reach an agreement by then. They didn't, and the country officially reopened on August 24, although there wasn't a state of emergency in place since June 15.

*Answer:* *No answer entered* 

*Comments*:
 On 11 May the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. The law gives the government similar powers as a state of emergency for an additional 45 days. Under this new law, the state of emergency has been re-declared, and extended several times. Last extension was on August 14, 2020, for an additional 45 days (45 days after the official publication in government Gazzette which was on August 19, therefore until October 4).
''Authorities in Gabon have extended the country's State of Health Emergency measures for 45 days from Aug. 14, 2020. A nightly 2000-0500 curfew remains in effect.

 Initially declared from 21 March until 21 April 2020, extended until 22 May 2020. On 22 May 2020, the state of emergency ended. Restrictive measures were in place until 15 July (introduced as amendments to the "Law on Public Health" by the parliament on 22 May 2020).

*Comments*:
 The Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4). The president initially imposed restrictions on movement, gatherings, and travel for two to three weeks. He has invoked the right and extended the provisions on several occasions, most recently 15 June 2020. Presently, according to E.I. 64 of 15 March, the main emergency provisions under the restrictions act are set to expire on 31 July. However, there are reports from August & September which state that "[...] we are still required under the Imposition of Restrictions Act 2020 [...]" and I have also not found evidence of it lifted/expired to date.

*Answer:* *No answer entered* 

*Comments*:
 The strictest measure, i.e. the lockdown, has been lifted since May 5, 2020. However, the greek government has continued using art 44 of the Constitution as a legal instrument to deal with the pandemic and pass legislation.
For instance, in late July (31) and August 2020, more measures were taken to deal with the second wave. These measures are both nationwide - mandatory wearing of masks in enclosed spaces-, but also local, for areas with high number of covid19 cases such as Athens, Thessaloniki, and several islands.

# Hungary 
*Answer*: 2020-06-17 

*Comments*:
 Decree 282/2020 from 17 June lifted the state of emergency and terminated the Coronavirus Protection Act from 30 March 2020. Was replaced by the state of epidemiological preparedness (Decree 283/2020) without an end date. The "LAW ON TRANSITIONAL RULES AND HEALTH PREPAREDNESS RELATED TO THE CESSATION OF THE STATE OF DANGER " from 17 June 2020 " introduces measures related to the revocation of the "state of danger" in Hungary. However, the law expands the powers of the government during another exceptional state, by authorizing the government to issue wide-ranging decrees without parliamentary approval during a “state of medical crisis.” During such a state, the law authorizes the government to suspend existing laws and restrict fundamental rights such as freedom of movement and assembly. The government may declare a “state of medical crisis” unilaterally, based on the recommendation of a government-appointed medical officer; the “state of medical crisis” can last up to six months and may be renewed by government decree. According to critics, the law gives the government expansive leeway to rule with minimal judicial and parliamentary scrutiny for an indefinite period." (ICNL)

 The legislature refused to approve a measure that would have extended the state of emergency beyond the initial 14 day period allowed for in the constitution. At that time, it had been suspended by the prime minister. Later the constitutional court ruled the suspension of parliament unconstitutional. It has since been reinstated and the prime minister resigned.

The state of emergency and the imposed lockdown were eased on May 5, 2020, but the government reinstated lockdown measures in late July to curb the spread of the virus in response to the rapid increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases between June and August. see legal notice no.68 of August 26, 2020.

# Malawi 
*Answer*: 2020-04-19 

*Comments*:
 The Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act allows for an initial state of disaster to last for three months and to be extended for another three months. President Mutharika initially announced a 30-day period for the state of disaster. Later, on 01 April, the government invoked the Public Health Act to issue the Public Health (Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management) Rules on 08 April. However, the 21-day lockdown proposed in these rules was halted by the High Court of Malawi on 17 April 2020. We code the end of the initial 30-day period for the state of disaster because we could find no evidence of its extension.

# Papua New Guinea 

*Answer:* *No answer entered* 

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was extended a couple of times, but was not extended beyond June 16, and has thus ended. However, on June 16, it was replaced with the National Pandemic Act, which transfers most emergency powers to this law. As most emergency powers are thus still in place, this does not count as having ended. 
Note that some subnational state's of emergency have been kept in place or implemented, especially in the region of Bougainville. Note also that PNG introduced a new legislation (see misclimit for more information) that has some emergency powers even thoug the State of Emergency has ended. However, the national state of emergency which is the primary legal instrument here has ended.

 The state of emergency was initially declared on April 1 for a three-month period (until early July). It had been renewed twice, first on July 3 for 45 more days (until 16 August ), and extended again to September 15.
The last reneweal took place on September 15 for an additional period of 6 months, until March 2021:

...''the Togolese National Assembly, meeting in plenary this Tuesday, September 15, 2020, has just authorized the government to extend the exceptional measure, over a period of 06 additional months (until March 2021 therefore)....Concretely, two bills have been adopted by the legislative power: a first extending the period of authorization of the government to take its measures by ordinance for six months, and a second authorizing the public power to extend the state of emergency.
The final duration of each period should be set by presidential decree, depending on the evolution of the pandemic.''

 Per law, powers by article 70 can only last max 2 months. Article 80 has no time limit unless the parliament wants to challenge the necessity of it. The delegation of extra powers to the prime minister expired.

 On July 3, The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020 was repealed on and replaced with The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) Regulations 2020, which relaxed some emergency measures. As the UK still has emergency provisions in place, this does not count as it having ended.

*Comments*:
 The Civil Protection Act, section 27:2: "The declaration of a state of disaster in terms of subsection (1) shall remain in force for a period of three months, the President may, from time to time, by statutory instrument, extend such declaration". The state of disaster has not been found to no longer be in effect, and the measures, such as lockdown, are extended for an indefinite period. Thus, it seems the state of disaster is still in effect.

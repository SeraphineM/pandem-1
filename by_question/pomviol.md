 There have been several reports on police violence in Belgium with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures during the March-June 2020 period. 

 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and to date two people from racialised groups have died at the hands of the police, in France and in Belgium. (Adil C., 19 years old, who died on 10 April 2020 in Belgium.)'' (1, 3, 5)
''incidents of disproportionate policing of Romani people and Travellers have also cropped up in Belgium, where an armed response team evicted families, including a pregnant woman and children, from their caravans''. (2)
''The media and NGOs reported the disproportionate impact of the enforcement of lockdown measures on working class neighbourhoods, home to a large minority ethnic community.
 The Human Rights League collected allegations of abusive police practices between 18 March and 29 May. In 36% of the cases police allegedly use the force unlawfully, in 21% of the cases they uttered insults. Forty per cent of the victims were racialized people.'' (5, 7)

 There are reports of some instances of physical harassment against Rohingyans by both police and military who guard checkpoints in place due to emergency measures. However, no sources found have stated any more severe cases of violence, or that this physical harassment is widespread. While there are no reports of this is the second period, there is no indication that the situation has improved. This is therefore coded as 1 for both periods. 
Note here that the substantial violence by the military in the Rakhine state is not part of the emergency measures, and no sources have mentioned that the state or military have excused or legitimized that violence with any reference to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 'Days after Congo announced emergency restrictions to curb the new coronavirus, a police video started circulating online showing an officer in the capital beating a taxi driver for violating a one-passenger limit.''

''State security forces, in responding to lawbreaking and violence, should respect human rights including only using force when strictly necessary. On March 29, Gen. Sylvano Kasongo, the head of police in Kinshasa, appeared to be ordering police officers to beat a motorcycle-taxi driver, in apparent “punishment” for violating social distancing measures, video footage indicated.''

''On March 30, the police killed at least 3 people and wounded 11 others, according to a UN source, when they fired live rounds at members of the Bundu dia Kongo politico-religious movement who were demonstrating in Kinshasa to “chase the spirit of the coronavirus.” The authorities should issue clear orders to the security forces that they are to act with restraint while enforcing restrictions in place.''

''On Tuesday, June 9, Kinshasa police used live fire to disperse merchants at the Central Market in Kinshasa. The merchants were trading despite the mandated closure of the market due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Two people were reportedly killed during the police intervention, although it is not immediately clear if they were shot or trampled by the crowd. The interior minister has halted the cleanup of the market pending an investigation into the incident.''

*Comments*:
 There have been several reports on police violence in France with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures during the March-June 2020 period. 

''The COVID-19 pandemic further revealed the heavy policing and the recurrent unlawful use of force in urban areas in France....'' 
Moreover, in the cases documented by Amnesty International, law enforcement officials resorted to the unlawful use of force while enforcing the measures, which in some instances may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.'' (2)

Amnesty International verified 15 videos of instances of unlawful use of force and/or racist and homophobic insults by law enforcement officials from 18 March to 26 April 2020 in 15 different French cities...In none of these situations was the use of force justified by a legitimate operational objective as none of those assaulted posed any apparent threat to thephysical integrity of law enforcement officials or others.'' (2) 
 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and to date two people from racialised groups have died at the hands of the police, in France and in Belgium. (Mohamed Gabsi, 33 years old, who died on 8 April 2020 in France.)'' (1)

*Time period: Jul/Sep*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 State security forces had resorted in excess use of violence to enforce the emergency measures. The state of emergency has been extended through October 16, 2020.

In May 2020, six protesters died in Guinea during clashes with the police, where crowds were protesting against road barriers set up to control traffic between the capital and the rest of the country. (1)

''A report by Amnesty Intenational accuses security forces in Guinea of taking advantage of the pretext of enforcing measures to curb against COVID-19 to escalate violence against civilians. At least seven people have died during clashes between the population and law enforcement forces. The rights group notes that a systematic crackdown against regime critics began in March.''

''On April 8, a 30-year-old woman said that a uniformed man who accused her of breaking the curfew robbed and beat her."

 There are several reports on security forces in engaging in severe violence in reaction to protests and riots at prisons due to the Covid-19 situation, and the inmates incapacity to protect themselves from it spreading. Amnesty International reports that up to 36 inmates have been killed by security forces during these protests.
While no violence in enforcing the emergency measures have been found when it comes to civilians outside the prisons, there are several reports of lethal violence occuring at the hands of security forces in reaction to inmates not following the regulations and protesting on Covid-19 related issues. This is therefore coded as 2.
However, no evidence of such violence, or any other violence by law enforcement, has been found for the second period, and this is therefore only coded 2 for the first period.

# Israel 
*Time period: Mar/Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul/Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 There are a few isolated reports of violence from police in enforcing emergency measures during both periods, primarily in relation to using what has been regarded excessive force in response to protests of the emergency measures and/or people refusing to comply to some regulations like wearing face masks. The reports do not indicate widespread violence, and the sources are mostly local media outlets. Less evidence has been found from big media outlets on this, and HRW and Amnesty do not report any incidents of police violence. Due to the few reports of violence in both periods, this is coded as 1 for both periods.
Note also that  the ongoing violence in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel is not regarded here, as this violence is not connected to the emergency measures, and Covid-19 has not been used as an excuse for such violence by the Israeli government or authorities.

 There are a series of police brutality incidents in Kenya, many with lethal outcomes. The nationwide curfew has been extended through November 28, 2020.

''Rights group Amnesty International said Kenyan police had killed at least 100 people in 2020, with 21 related to COVID infractions, such as curfew enforcement or mask violations.
At least six people were killed in the first 10 days alone, according to Human Rights Watch. President Kenyatta had cause to apologize for police excesses in one of his coronavirus addresses.'' (3)

''Enforcement of virus containment regulations turned deadly in Lessos, a small town in Kenya's Rift Valley where a witness confirmed that three people were killed during a confrontation between police and residents over the wearing of face masks.'' (June 29) (2)

''According to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), 15 people have been killed by the police (as of June 15) and 31 injured for breaching the curfew. These cases have included:
The beating of a truck driver in Nakuru on 27 March.
On 30 March, a 13 year-old boy, Yassin Moyo, was shot to death by the police as he was standing on the balcony of his parents' home in Nairobi a few minutes after curfew. In June, the IPOA announced that a police officer had been charged with his murder.
On the night of 1 June, a homeless man popularly known as Vaite was shot dead in Mathare (Nairobi) shortly after the curfew.'' (1)

*Comments*:
 There are reports of security forces using violence in quelling protests from migrant workers, which are directly related to Covid-19 as these workers have protested being stranded in camps due to Covid-19 not enabling them to travel to their home country. However, the violence so far is non-lethal according to the reports. While such reports have only been found for the first period, there are no indications that the situation has improved. This is therefore coded as 1 for both periods.

*Time period: Jul/Sep*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The mass protests against the Lebanese government that were ongoing before the Covid-19 crisis started again March and April, and there are some reports of violent clashes between protesters and security forces, with at least one protester being killed. In the reports, this is in direct relation to Covid-19, as the quelling of the protests was motivated by them breaking the Covid-19 restrictions. This is therefore coded as 2, as there are recurring tensions between protesters and security forces which in some cases have escalated, but not a systematic use of violence to enforce emergency measures. However, no reports of any Covid-19 related law enforcement violence has been found in the second period. While there have been protests in relation to the Beirut explosion, the reporting on this makes no reference to Covid-19, and the violence occurring under these circumstances are thus not motivated by or part of the Covid-19 emergency measures. Therefore, this is only coded 2 for the first period.

 During the beginning weeks of the lockdown, security forces used truncheons enforcing the restrictions. On 16 April, soldiers enforcing lockdown rules entered homes and injured residents in Slipway and Crown communities. Three Liberian soldiers have been recalled after a woman was stabbed in the arm. One of them was later found guilty of assaulting the woman.

No further evidence was found that indicates that security forces, such as the civilian police or military, has engaged in physical violence to execute the emergency measures later on.

 Tensions heightened after a police officer allegedly beat a street vendor, accused of violating an afternoon ban on commercial activities. Images of the victim were shared on social media, sparking fury among residents of Toamasina in eastern Madagascar.''
''The police have denied perpetrating any violence and instead allege that the street vendor had returned home following a short visit to the hospital. Protestors burnt tires, blocked roads and threw stones at security forces who, in turn, fired rubber bullets. The protestors claimed that COVID-19 did not exist in the town and the state was manipulating them.''

 Police has clashed with protestors and fired teargas at them. While this is bad, it does not appear that dispersing the protestors were part of any covid-19 emergency measure enforcements. If they would have been dispersed because they were accused of violating social distancing rules or the like, that would affect this score, but nothing indicative of that was found.

*Comments*:
 Security forces in Mauritania have engaged in violence to enforce the emergency measures during the March-June period. No more instances were found during July-September, and the emergency measures were lifted on July 10, 2020.

 'In other instances, security forces have at times resorted to violence against those breaking the curfew, with one video circulating on social media showing police beating, in the middle of a Nouakchott street, those who had turned out to protest against an activist's arrest.'' (1)

Another incident was found, but it hasn't been possible to verify if the information is valid or credible, nor to find additional sources that report the incident, therefore it is not included in the coding score.
''Abass Hamadi Diallo, born in 1986, was in southern Mauritania on 28 May near the border with Senegal that at the time was observing curfew regulations imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The young man, father of six, was helping a dark man and his nephew with the transport of merchandise when a gunshot hit him fatally in the chest.'' (2)

*Time period: Jul/Sep*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 People have been punished for violating the curfew and the punishments or penalities have been inhumane. For example

1: Police and local officials in several parts of the country have mistreated people detained for violating COVID-19 regulations, including by confining them to dog cages and forcing them to sit for hours in the midday sun.

2: Two children were locked in a coffin on 26 March 2020 as punishment for violating curfew.

3: In Binondo, Manila, village officials arrested four boys and four girls on March 19 for violating curfew. They forcibly cut the hair of seven of the children while the one who resisted was stripped naked and ordered to walk home.

4: A video posted on July 23, showed a police officer kicking a man's leg and pushing him to the ground before kneeling on his neck and mouth. This occured after the man was found to have been riding a motorcycle without a face mask, violating Covid-19 rules.

 Dozens of migrants workers from Nepal were placed in detention centers and then deported after being approched by the police who said that they were going to get tested for covid-19 (detained on 12 and 13 March 2020, deported on 15 and 19 March 2020) (also see discrim), which is a case of unlawful confinement. I have not found eny evidence that the situation improved or got worse. General reporting on migrants' rights in Qatar shows that the overall situation has not changed much.

*Comments*:
 There have been reports of the police killing two persons, but it is not very clear whether this was to enforce lockdown measures - Rwandan police has rejected these accusations. For this reason, but also because it is only this incident reported, coding is 1 (although allegedly with lethal outcomes).

''Rwandan police shot and killed two people who attacked officers while on routine patrol. ''People should not confuse the measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 with this unfortunate incident,'' the police said on Twitter.''

 Police in Senegal have fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters demanding an end to coronavirus restrictions. '' (June 5, 2020)

''In Senegal, where clashes between police and civilians are rare, the first night of a nationwide curfew in late March was marred by violence. Videos posted online showed police swiping at fleeing civilians with batons. Reuters could not verify the footage, but police in a statement apologised for the use of ''excessive interventions''and promised to punish officers involved.''
''Footage from Senegal surfaced last week showing policemen beating people found outside after a night curfew. In one video, officials force three young men to do squats after they were caught exercising at night. Police eventually assured that all "excessive interventions" had been punished.''

 There have been multiple instances of the police using physical violence to execute the emergency measures prior to July 2020. 

1: On June 2020, police arrested 53 people who were participating in a black lives matter protest in Colombo close to the U.S embassy. An earlier court order has disallowed protests in the general area. Video recordings showed that the police used violence while the protestors were protesting peacefully.

2: On June 2020, CCTV footage showed policemen assaulted a teenager with autisim who was unable to communicate why he was outside during the curfew.

I did not find additional information on instance of police or military violence to execute the emergency measures after July 2020.

 'On 2 April, President Faure Gnassingbé, Eyadéma’s son, announced a state of emergency and a curfew to go into immediate effect. The government deployed 5,000 soldiers who beat and assaulted civilians that same evening. Photos of a young man who suffered a ghastly eye injury at the hands of security forces went viral within the community. Some expressed sympathy for the victim. Others showed support for the soldiers purportedly doing their jobs. Soon, however, the reports escalated. A video emerged of an old woman who had been severely wounded by soldiers after allegedly violating the curfew. Days later, a young man named Gueli Kodjo Djifa died after being beaten. The minister of security said an epileptic attack was the cause of death, but the family says he was tortured by security forces. This time, there was more public uproar as people realised that injustice meted out on a few can be carried out against all.''  (2, 3)

*Comments*:
 There are some reports that the Turkish police have used force (tear gas, rubber bullets and detentions) when trying to stop HDP demonstrations against the government. Stopping these demonstrations have been made with reference to Covid-19, that the demonstrations contribute to spreading the disease and therefore needs to be stopped. There is also one report by Human Rights Watch that states that there are a few reported instances where police have used excessive force when for example scattering or fining people in areas for not following Covid-19 regulations. These are however the only reports of such violence in enforcing the measures that have been found, and this is therefore coded as 1.

*Comments*:
 While there have been numerous incidents of police violence in the US since March, no reports have been found that any of these are linked to enforcing Covid-19 restrictions, or that any other use of excessive force has occurred within the Covid-19 emergency measures. This is therefore coded as 0 for both periods.

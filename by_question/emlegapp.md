The measures adopted by the King can have a retroactive effect to the 1st March, 2020. So far, the federal government has adopted (and published) five Special Powers Decrees (....).... 
The draft proposal explains that the government has to keep the Chamber of Representatives informed about the measures it takes in virtue of its special powers. However, this obligation was not formalised in the final act.'' (2)

The text was voted after several hours of debate in the French parliament and includes measures that would reduce private liberties (such as confinement and requisitions).''

# Kenya 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The activation of the PHA and the POA both need parliamentary approval (1, 2). However, with the exception of measures related to tax reductions and financial cushion to Kenyan citizens (4), none of the other measures were approved by the National Assembly. The initial Covid19 measures were implemented with the Presiential Directive on March 15, while the first legal provisions and piece of legislation came later: THE PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION, CONTROL AND SUPPRESSION OF COVID-19) RULES, 2020 - ARRANGEMENT OF REGULATIONS, by the legal notice n.49 on 3rd April 2020, and the PUBLIC ORDER ACT (legal notice n.36, March 26), all with imeediate effect as ministerial decisions.

''The Public Health (PHA) and Public Order Acts (POA) have been the primary legal instruments that gave authorities executive powers during the pandemic. A series of regulations, rules, and guidelines have been published including: curfew orders; declarations of infected areas and restrictions of movement; and regulations and rules on the prevention, control, and suppression of COVID-19.'' (1)

''a number of directives raise procedural questions. The procedure in adopting regulations has been contrary to the Statutory Instruments Act (3), which requires that delegated legislation be approved by Parliament. The regulations have been implemented with immediate effect rendering Parliament's interrogation into legality moot. The National Assembly has declined to approve regulations on the Prevention, Control and Suppression of COVID-19 and the Restriction of Movement of Persons and Related Measures, but the State has continued to implement them.

The Judiciary has already taken a decision on the legality of the curfew orders, holding that curfew is lawful but finding the use of unreasonable force in its imposition unlawful.'' (3)

 The Parliament had been prorogued (March 19, 2020) in the initial declaration of the state of emergency (retrospectively on March 28, 2020, to be in force from March 18). In the second declaration of the state of emergency on April 15, 2020 the Parliament properly approved the extension, since the Constitutional court had ruled the suspension unconstitutional.

# Mali 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 In addition to the developments below, Mali is facing internal political turbulence, and the President and Prime Minister resigned on August 18, 2020 following a military coup:
''On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta announced his resignation, explaining that he had no other choice but to submit to the will of his army in revolt to prevent blood from being spilled.'' (1)

'Mali parliamentary elections were held on March 29, 2020 (second round on April 19) despite the coronavirus situation, as they had been postponed several times since 2018. The legislature's mandate at the time was to expire on May 2 2020. (2, 3). The new president of the National Assembly was finally elected on May 12.

Because of the above, the Cabinet of Ministers of Mali passed a bill on April 1 2020 that authorized the government to take covid19 related measures by ordinances, with a duration period from Appril 1 until May when the parliamentary elections will have been concluded. No evidence was found on whether the bill was eventually adopted by the new Parliament after May 2020. Further, because of the political instability and the military coup, no evidence was found on the bill being adopted at all.

When the president declared a new state of emergency in August, the parliament approved the decree, but the opposition criticized the decision, which they considered unconstitutional since the state of emergency had already been extended the three times allowed by the constitution.

 The parliament was dissolved since 16 February 2020 due to parliamentary elections (i.e. not covid-19) and therefore the declaration and extensions of the state of emergency were made by the government. Each decision has provisions for the need to be approved by the parliament, as soon as its able to meet. At the time of coding, the parliament has met and but not yet approved the decisions (both to declare a state of emergency and to extend it several times) yet.

 In Senegal, the National Assembly voted on April 1 the bill empowering the President of the Republic to "take, by ordinances, measures within the domain of the law to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic". The Presiden had said on March 23 when he declared a state of emergency: "I will refer to the National Assembly a bill empowering the President of the Republic to take, for a period of three months, measures within the domain of the law".

 The National Disaster Management Act (2002) does not require that the National Assembly approve the declaration of the national state of disaster, its end date, or its extension. These powers belong solely to the executive. However, petitions can be brought before the courts to repeal the measure.

# The Gambia 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The legislature has approved the declaration of public emergency on 27 March, and the extensions on 3 April. However, after the Parliament didn't approved another extension on 16 May, the president used an executive order to extend it. Furthermore, the second State of Public Emergency was declared and extended with executive orders and not approved by parliament. Therefore 'emlegapp' is coded as 0.

 Turkey has used a varied set of existing legal instruments to implement emergency response (e.g.  The Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no.5442)), and there is therefore no single legal instrument to highlight here.

 The President does not need the approval of Parliament to declare a state of disaster, according to section 27 of the Civil Protection Act. The Parliament is merely informed that such declaration has been made. Section 28 of the Civil Protection Act states: "Where a state of disaster has been declared in terms of section twenty-seven, the Minister shall communicate such declaration to Parliament on the day that it next sits after the declaration is made."

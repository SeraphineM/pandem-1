 According to International IDEA, "On 25 March, Parliament approved a declaration of a state of natural calamity, granting emergency powers to the government for 30 days." Inter-Ministerial Committee of Civil Emergencies (KNEC) (Komiteti Ndërministror i Emergjencave Civile (KNEC)) was in charge of coordinating covid-19 emergency response for the duration of the state of natural disaster (point 3 of decision 243 on the declaration of the state of natural disaster from 24 March 2020). The state of natural disaster ended on 23 June 2020 and I found no new measures limiting the lawmaking power of the legislature.

# Algeria 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 In March, the U.S. Library of Congress reported that the Chairman of the National Assembly had postponed all sessions and activities as a preventive measure against Covid-19. But on 22 April 2020, Aljazeera reported that the National Assembly passed a new law to criminalize fake news in a fairly empty sitting due to social distancing measures. In addition, the IDEA data on legislatures says that the Algerian National Assembly has normal procedure in April. However, the legislature is still not entirely suspended, given that any laws passed while the legislature was temporarily suspended must be retroactively agreed to, but severe restrictions on who can attend and take the floor in the legislature.

# Australia

 When a Biosecurity Emergency is in place, the  "Biosecurity Act provides that emergency requirements determined by the Health Minister under subsection 477(1) are not subject to disallowance by the Parliament." (quote from https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Scrutiny_of_Delegated_Legislation/Scrutiny_of_COVID-19_instruments).
However, these powers given to the Health Minister are fairly narrow and focused on health-related measures. This is therefore coded as 2 - the Health Minister has the right to rule by decree on narrowly Covid-19 related issues.
The Biosecurity Emergency has been extended, and is currently set to end at December 17, and this is thus coded 2 for both periods.

Such measures include requiring masks and closing borders, curfews, social distancing measures and limits on public gatherings. Some of these have been eased since 30 April.

# Central African Republic 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 While the Constitution authorizes the president to declare a state of emergency, requiring that the National Assembly enact public health emergency laws, the president has thus far avoided this and the government has enacted social distancing measures and other restrictions through a series of gradual announcements without reference to a specific legal instrument. The legislature continues to convene but with social distancing guidelines. On 20 May, it questioned the government's response to the pandemic, citing poor performance despite its emergency measures. In addition, the Constitutional Court ruled on 05 June that it would be unconstitutional for the president and parliamentary terms to be extended due to the pandemic. Elections scheduled for December 2020 and May 2020, respectively should continue as planned.

''On 5 June 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Central African Republic (CAR) rejected as unconstitutional a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the extension of the duration of presidential and parliamentary terms in the case of 'force majeure'. The proposed amendment emerged in a context of the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic causing concerns over the timely organisation of presidential and legislative elections in December 2020 and March 2021, respectively.''

 The Civil Protections Headquarters was given the power to decide on emergency measures related to covid-19, which is coded as 2 both during March-June and July-September periods. The parliament limited its meetings and adopted measures for working during the pandemic (e.g. remote meetings, social distancing, sanitation, etc.) and it voted to dissolve itself on 18 May 2020, in preparation for elections on 5 July 2020. The first sitting of the new parliament took place on 21 July 2020. 

According to OSCE report (p.71), the measures were addressed retroactively by the parliament: "accelerated legislative processes have also been used to adopt legislative acts in order to retroactively provide a legal basis for government action already undertaken or being implemented" and "the Civil Protection Authority adopted quarantines measures and movement restrictions based on legislation that says such measures should be adopted by the Minister of Health. The situation was retroactively addressed by Parliament, potentially contravening the general prohibition of retroactive effect."

 The power of the government is defined by Crisis Act No. 240/2000 (Chapter 2, points 5&6) giving it the right to rule by decree on measures related to the emergency (specific provisions, therefore coded as 2). Meetings in the parliament were cancelled from 11 March until 14 April 2020. The state of emergency ended on 17 May and I found no evidence of further measures limiting the lawmaking role of the legislature.

# Democratic Republic of the Congo 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The Senate and National Assembly of the DRC decided on March 18 to suspend all sessions for the month of March due to COVID-19 (until April 5).The regular session opened on 16 March, but all legislative activities were suspended from 18 March to 05 April due to Covid-19. Since then, the legislature has resumed with special rules of procedure for social distancing. While the legislature must approve the state of emergency, this gives powers to the executive to rule by decree "the measures necessary to respond to the situation" using ordinances deliberated through the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister and the National Assembly, however, may challenge the government and consider motions of no confidence or censorship.

 The legal instrument, the amenmdent, does not affect the parliaments lawmaking role. It does provide the Health Minister some extraordinary power, but these powers are defined and demarcated in the amendment that parliament passed, and does not provide measures that could impact the lawmaking role of the parliament as such.

# El Salvador 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The legislative was still working, but the executive had the autonomy to rule by decree. The Law on Civil Protection, Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, art. 25 says that "In the event that a State of Emergency is decreed, the President of the Republic will be the highest authority in the execution of contingency plans for civil protection, as well as disaster mitigation". The legislative decree n. 593, that declared a state of emergency, says that "The Ministry of Health shall perform all the necessary actions, in order to comply with the Plan for Prevention, Containment and Response to the covid-19 pandemic and provide the essential public services to prevent its spread among the inhabitants of the Republic". The vague formulation of the law gives the executive the right to rule by decree on issues that may exceed covid-19 related issues. However, the law also defines that the executive needs legislative approval for measures that impose limits to constitutional rights. Once the state of emergency ended in June, the executive tried to renew it via executive decree, but the supreme court ruled it uncostitutional because it did not have legislative approval.

# Greece 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The greek government throughout the pandemic has been taking decisions and issuing laws based on art 44 of the Constitution, which gives extra powers to the executive for ''fast-track'' law-making, through the so-called ''Acts of Legislative Content''. These Acts need parliamentary approval after their issuance, and are usually accompanied by ''(Common) Ministerial Decisions'' (KYA in greek), which are government decisions that specify in more detail the general measures taken with the Acts.

The Legislature continues working as normal, but with fewer sessions and fewer MPs present. The parliamentary oversight is still in place and functioning. ''Plenary: Reduced quorum, Committee: Limited to urgent matters, Voting mechanism: Ballot paper, Staff: Non-essential are working remotely.Used procedure of 'organized debate'. Committees can conduct meetings physically or remotely.'' (1, 2)Also, the Greek Parliament decided to only vote on one draft bill per week, with priority given to bills related to the management of the coronavirus outbreak. (3)However, the government has been criticized  of eroding parliamentary scrutiny in the midst of the pandemic (6), mainly for having launched several non-covid19 related laws, many of which quite important (environmental bills, education), with fast-track processes.

# Hong Kong 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The emergency legislation put in place during the pandemic has not regarded or affected the parliaments work, and no general state of emergency or emergency legislation has been declared that allows the government to rule by decree. While some measures have been taken by the government without parliamentary approval, these emergency powers existed prior to Covid-19, and therefore no emergency measures taken in relation to Covid-19 has changed the parliaments law making role. Furthermore, the parliament has continued to work during the pandemic. This is therefore coded 0.¬†
It is worth noting that Hong Kong postponed their planned parliamentary elections in September 2020 by a year. This has however not affected the current parliaments work, and this parliament continues to sit until the next election.¬†

# Hungary 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 On 30 March 2020, the parliament approved extension of the state of emergency (Coronavirus Protection Act,  Decree 9790) and authorized the government to rule by decree, but the government needs to regularly inform the parliament on its decisions. Coded as 3 due to vague formulations in March-June 2020 period. The Coronavirus Protection Act was withdrawn on 18 June 2020 following the end of the state of emergency. I did not find any limitations on the lawmaking role of the legislature during the state of epidemiological preparedness (declared from 18 June). Note that according to the Act on Transitional Rules (Act LVIII of 2020 on the transitional rules related to the termination of the state of danger and on the epidemiological preparedness (2020. évi LVIII. törvény a veszélyhelyzet megszűnésével összefüggő átmeneti szabályokról és a járványügyi készültségről)), the government can declare a "state of medical crisis" that would enable the executive to rule by decree (as of the time of coding, Hungary is in a state of epidemiological preparedness).

# Iran 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The Iranian Parliament's law making role has not been affected by the emergency measures taken by Iran, according to the IPU. Parlamentarians have primarily worked remotely, but they have for example worked with the government to pass financial aid packages during the pandemic. And no other indications have been found that the Iranian parliament has been restricted in its power or law making role during the pandemic (beyond the already existing restrictions where several formal and informal powers can monitor and veto the parliament's actions, but this is not related to Covid-19 or the emergency measures). No information has been found indicating that Iran's parliament has been limited in any such way by emergency measures under the second period either. This is therefore coded as 0.

It is normal in this period that there would be few sittings. Both Houses met to pass emergency legislation in late March.".
Most work is done remotely, and parts of the regular programme have been cancelled so that parliament only works on Covid-19 related issues, but they have convened when necessary and they have passed the bills enabling the emergency response, and no indication is given that this response in turn has limited the parliaments lawmaking role or power in any way. This is therefore coded as 0.

# Israel 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The new parliament was sworn in on 16 March, and some committees and regular work was not fully up and running at the end of march, and only a certain amount of MPs were initially allowed in the Plenary at the same time due to health reasons. The Knesset did not work according to a regular programme, but rather focused its work on the Covid-19 pandemic. It is once again convening fully, however, and there's no indication that the parliaments lawmaking role was limited before or during this due to the emergency measures (the parliament was temporarily closed for four days due to the speaker refusing to obey the regulations and initiate elections for a new speaker, but his actions were overruled by the court, a new speaker was chosen and parliamentary work resumed - this four day hiatus is not linked to any emergency measures, but was an act of the previous speaker himself that caused it).
However, on July 21 the Knesset passed the "Major Corona Law", which now underlines the governments emergency response, and in which they were given extended emergency powers during a state of emergency, as well as the right to declare it for 60 days rather than 7. Within this law, Government is also allowed to rule by decree on measures related to Covid-19 that is deemed acute and cannot be passed through parliament first. However, this law fairly strictly pertains to issues related to the emergency itself (and the powers only exist as long as the SOE is in place), and the parliament still has powers to review the passing of emergency legislation to later terminate it, as well as being able to terminate the state of emergency itself. Therefore, this is coded as 2 - the government can rule by decree on a number of Covid-19 related issues - from the point where this new law came into effect. This is therefore coded as 2 only for the second period.

The Italian government has since the state of emergency declaration issued a number of emergency measures through decree laws, which in the Italian legal system is an instrument that allows the Government to enact measures that become effective immediately, but which must be voted on by the Parliament within 60 days or the decree is terminated. Consequently, while the government has the power to present decrees which are implemented before the parliament votes on it, the parliament can terminate it as soon as it convenes to vote on the decree (Article 77, Italian Constitution). Since the Italian Parliament have continued its work throughout the pandemic (and so far approved all decree laws), this is regarded as not having affected their law making role. Furthermore, there's no indication that any of the emergency measures themselves have in any way affected the law making role of the parliament. This is therefore coded as 0.

# Ivory Coast 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The President can rule by decree on covid19 related issues. 
Also: ''The Ivorian Constitution provides, ''when the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the integrity of its territory or the execution of it international commitments are under grave and immediate threat, and that the regular operation of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures required by the circumstances, after officially consulting with the Prime Minister, the Presidents of [the National Assembly and the Senate], as well as the Constitutional Council. The same article of the Constitution specifies that the President may not dissolve the National Assembly during such times, and that the Parliament always has the right to meet. There does not appear to be any formal provision in Ivorian law regarding the functioning of the national legislature under emergency measures, nor does Ivorian law appear to provide for any sort of “emergency parliament” with devolved powers from the whole parliament to address crisis situations.''

''Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the National Assembly has limited all meetings to a maximum of 50 participants. Furthermore, the President of the National Assembly has requested that all members, staff, and visitors wash their hands or use the hand sanitizer available at washing stations installed at the building’s entrances and exits.''

# Jordan 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency under the Defence Law gives the prime minister far reaching authority and full responsibility to enact emergency measures. The parliament still meets however, and can for example question the prime minister on the actions taken under the Defense Law, although their law making role is significantly curtailed under the state of emergency. This is therefore coded as 3. No evidence has been found that the state of emergency has ended by time of coding, and this is coded as 3 for both periods.

# Kazakhstan

 Based on Chapter 3, Article 12 of the law on states of emergencies, the lawmaking power with regards to the emergency is given to a  special state commission that is composed members of the executive, legislature and other ministers (e.g. Minister of health, defense etc.), which is led by the President.  The state of emergency ended on 11 May 2020 and I found no new measures limiting the lawmaking power of the legislature.

# Kuwait 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The Kuwaiti parliament initially postponed meetings and cancelled some sittings due to health reasons, but now continues to operate normally, and has thus not been suspended. However, the government have responded to the crisis using a series of decrees on emergency response, and has far reaching powers that limit parliaments law making role, and this is therefore coded as 3. Nothing in the second period has been found indicating that this situation has changed, and this is therefore coded as 3 for both periods.

# Kyrgyzstan 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The government declared a state of emergency in certain areas that was ratified by the legislature on 24 March and extended on 14 April. The Constitution (Chapter 74, Article 5, point 1) says that the legislature has authority to ratify or repeal presidential decrees on emergency measures (“The Jogorku Kenesh shall introduce the state of emergency in cases and in accordance with procedure envisaged in the constitutional law, shall approve or repeal Presidential decrees on this matter”). The legislature ratified and, in some cases, recommended the government to make changes on emergency measures. There were also Q&A sessions where the government reported on the implementation of the emergency measures to the legislature. According to Inter Pares, the parliament followed normal procedures with limited activities due to the pandemic.

# Lebanon 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The parliamentary Union, Reuters and two local media outlets (The New Arab and Arab News) report that the Lebanese parliament meetings were postponed March 10 for health reasons. Since then, they have convened a couple of times, the first being at April 21, and they have during these sessions performed a lot of the regular parliamentary work. The parliament has also continued to hold sessions over the summer, and has for example voted on a separate state of emergency for the explosion in Beirut in August.  However, as the parliament has only held sparse sessions, the government has been given enhanced control during this time. This is therefore coded as 2, as the government has gained an increased capacity to rule by decree during the crisis and due to parliament not having regular sessions, but that parliament still convene and perform their work at times during the crisis means that it is neither suspended nor has let the government fully rule by decree.

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister prorogued (suspended) the legislature for three months on 20 March 2020. However, on 20 April 2020, the Constitutional Court rejected this decision and ordered the legislature to reopen. Subsequently, the embattled Prime Minister resigned. In addition, the Parliament has continued to work despite the suspension (2)

''Lesotho's Prime Minister, Thomas Thabane, on Friday 20 March 2020 issued a legal notice proclaiming that he had prorogued parliament.''

''Legal Notice 21 of 2020 contained a decision by the Prime Minister in terms of s 91(3) of the Constitution to prorogue Parliament from 20 March to 19 June 2020. The decision of the Prime Minister to prorogue Parliament was based on s 83 read together with s 91 of the Constitution. The decision was challenged and set aside in All Basotho Convention v The Prime Minister on the basis that it was irrational.''

# Lithuania 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 According to IDEA, "Seimas (Parliament) of Lithuania meetings have been limited. During the quarantine, it held only one weekly ordinary sitting and urgent hearings to discuss the Government’s draft legislation related to COVID-19. Critics argued that such urgent law-making created challenges for meaningful parliamentary scrutiny, sometimes resulting in rushed approval of laws submitted by the Government, according to analysts. Greater parliamentary scrutiny of the emergency declaration would have been considered desirable according to the same sources."

# Malawi 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act is vaguely formulated on what powers the executive has during a state of disaster: "extraordinary measures are necessary to assist and protect the persons affected or likely to be affected by the disaster in any area within Malawi or that circumstances are likely to arise making such measures." The Public Health Act, which was later invoked, is more specific with reference to prevention of disease spread. We code based on the state of disaster. On July 16, Parliament limited operations for 14 days due to confirmed cases among members of parliament and parliamentary staff. However, the legislature continued to work and is therefore not coded as suspension, dissolution or equivalent. The state of disaster seems to still be in effect as of September 30 2020, and the July/September period is therefore coded similarly to the March/June period.

# Malaysia 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988 activates the powers of the National Security Council Act of 2016, which gives the government and Minister of Health vast powers to rule by decree on a number of issues (see part V of the National Security Council Act of 2016). However, the parliament has convened and held sessions during the pandemic, and the government has not suspended it (although their meeting was  initially postponed due to Covid-19). This is therefore coded as 3. 
The situation stays the same under the extended control movement order, where the government can rule by decree on several issues, but the parliament still convenes and hold their sessions. This is therefore coded 3 for both periods.

 The legislative continued to work during the state of emergency, but the executive, especially the General Health Council (collegiate body that reports directly to the president) and the Secretary of Health, issued decrees to manage the covid-19 situation. The emergency law says that "The Ministry of Health will determine all the actions that are necessary to attend the emergency" (art. 2) and, because it is vaguely formulated, it allowed the government to rule by decree on matters that exceeded covid-19 issues.

 Section 2(1) of the Act enables the Government of Nepal to take "necessary action" and "issue necessary orders applicable to the general public or a group of any persons" to "root out or prevent" the development or spread of an infectious disease.

The Act is rather broad. Section 2(1) can, in theory, provide legal foundation for any government action taken to tackle COVID-19 both moderate and extraordinary.

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The Parliament adjourned and only worked remotely during the State of Emergency, but have convened again. While the emergency measures did force parliament to not work as usual, it did not affect its lawmaking role as it continued to pass urgent Covid-19 laws during the pandemic, and are now working as normal with their law making role being sustained.
Note also that the parliament was set to dissolve five weeks before electing the new parliament, which is standard practice in New Zealand, but that this has been postponed due to elections being pushed forward (the current date set is October 17). So the current parliament continues to work.

 The Nigerien legislature adopted on April 11, 2020 the bill extending the State of Emergency until July 11, 2020: ''This law aims to give the government the means to deal with the health emergency constituted by the coronavirus pandemic in a strengthened legal framework adaptable to the circumstances.

# North Macedonia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The parliament was dissolved since February 2020 due to general elections initially scheduled for 12 April 2020. Since the dissolution of the parliament had to be extended due to covid-19, leglimit is coded as 4. The new parliament met at the end of August but has not approved the declaration and extensions of the state of emergency (as of the time of coding). Based on the government's website, the President sent the decisions to the parliament for confirmation on 25 August. Leglimit is coded as 4 in both March-June and July-September period since the parliament was dissolved until 15 July elections.

According to IDEA, "The country has been facing challenges due to the lack of a functioning parliament. After the European Council failed to agree on the start of EU membership discussions for the country in October 2019, then Prime Minister Zoran brought the parliamentary elections forward from November to 12 April, seeking a fresh mandate. With a unanimous vote on 16 February, the Assembly was dissolved, paving the way to election and a technical unity government was formed, a recent custom to provide all parties with confidence in the election process. A month later, emergency powers were introduced as COVID-19 swept across Europe, and the election postponed by cross-party agreement. The state of emergency gives the government the ability to adopt and enforce decrees, all in the absence a parliament to provide accountability."

# Norway 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 "The IPU Reports that: ""The Norwegian Parliament (the Storting) introduced a number of measures which will be in place until end of April. These measures include: the number of MPs at plenary meetings and during voting is reduced to 87 from 102; plenary will take decisions only on urgent issues identified by the presidency following consultations with leaders of party groups in Parliament; some rules of procedure are temporarily suspended (deadlines, physical presence in Committee meetings with priority given to tele/video conferencing); reduced committee workload (priority given to urgent cases and bills); cancellation of international and domestic committee members travel. The Storting also established a coronavirus special committee. On 21 March, Parliament adopted the Enabling Act authorizing Government to make decisions which, according to the Constitution, must be taken in Parliament. The aim is to enable Government to take measures to limit the disruption of the normal functioning of society and mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic for the population and on the economy. The Act is valid for a month but can also be repealed by the Storting at any given time.""
Consequently, the law making role of the parliament is somewhat decreased as the government is given the right to make decisions that parliament usually needs to approve. However, as the parliament also passed an amendment on this stating that "" If at least one-third of the total number of Members does not support a regulation or parts of a regulation, the MPs in question may send a written declaration to the Storting’s Presidium. As soon as the Presidium receives such a declaration, it will notify the Government. The Corona Act obligates the King to revoke the regulations in question with immediate effect."" (https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/News-archive/Front-page-news/2019-2020/the-corona-act/)
Therefore, the parliament is still involved in urgent law making during the presence of the Corona Act, and only a third of the MPs is needed to revoke any regulation. Considering this, the law making role is regarded to not have been affected, since it both involved in some urgency law making and can revoke them. "

 Did not find any information on the lawmaking role of the legislature being limited due to the emergency measures. 

1: The military was impatient with the prime minister's initial reluctance to impose national lockdown, and deployed troops to enforce provincial-level restrictions.

2: The National Assembly of Pakistan was prorogued from 15 May to 05 June 2020 by the president, without direct reference to Covid-19. It has since resumed sittings. Initially some lockdown measures were adopted at the local level, to the dismay of the Prime Minister. According to a report by Brookings - "the government has since given in to a strange mix of pandemic denialism and exceptionalism".

# Papua New Guinea 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 During a state of emergency, the constitution in part allows for emergency laws (passed by parliament) and emergency regulation (decrees by the head of state). The parliament has approved three such emergency laws, and these constitute the legislation that outlines the overall emergency response. The capacity for the head of state to invoke temporary legislation, the emergency regulation, however does limit parliaments law making role to some extent. However, they are also restricted in time (expire after 28 days), can be revoked by parliament and may only be issued of the parliament cannot reasonably convene in time for passing such a regulation as an emergency law. It is thus coded as 2 under the State of Emergency. 
The state of emergency ended on June 16 and was replaced with National Pandemic Act. This allows for the government to appoint a controller to a temporary authority that administrates the measures taken under this act. This gives the government effective decree power to take these measures without consulting the parliament, but the extent of these measures are similarly restrained to Pandemic-related issues. This is therefore coded as 2 under this emergency law, and therefore coded 2 for the whole period.

# Rwanda 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The government has made several proclamations limiting movement, enforcing social distancing rules, and curfews, and at one stage lockdown, since mid-March. These have originated from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Local Government, and the Office of the Prime Minister, who has increasingly handled the government emergency response through the Cabinet. All of these decrees have originated from the executive, without direct vote from the legislature. The legislature continues to meet, but less regularly and with social distancing measures.

The lockdown on March 21 indeed affected the parliamentary meetings , which were held online, and the first time the Parliament convened since the partial lift of the Lockdown was on an extraordinary session on May 13 ''to allow to vote on and allow the Government to take loans meant to hasten the distribution of electricity''.

# Serbia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The parliament was dissolved from 4 March until 28 April 2020.  Since the dissolution of the parlimanet had to be extended due to covid-19, leglimit is coded as 4 during March-June 2020 period. 

On 4 March 2020, the President dissolved the parliament in preparation for 26 April parliamentary elections (later postponed to 21 June). According to Art.200 of the Constitution, the state of emergency is declared by the parliament and the parliament cannot be dissolved during the state of emergency. In case the parliament is unable to convene, the decision to declare the state of emergency is made by the President and Prime Minister. On 15 March, the state of emergency was declared by the President and the Prime Minister, which was not approved by the parliament since it was unable to convene because of a limit on public gatherings due to covid-19. The parliament did not function from 4 March until 28 April, and approved the declaration of the state of emergency (and other decrees on emergency measures; 44 decrees in total) retroactively on 28 April. On 6 May, the parliament voted to lift the state of emergency. Since I found no evidence of other measures limiting the lawmaking role of the legislature, leglimit is coded as 0 during July-September 2020 period.

# Sweden 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures does not affect the law making role of the parliament, and parliament still needs to approve measures taken by the government under the amendment.  The government can only enact regulations itself based on the amendment if it is of such urgency that it can't wait for parliamentary approval, and the parliament needs to be presented any such regulations as soon as possible and approve or deny it. Furthermore, any law making role outside of this amendment has not been affected by the emergency measures, and the parliament continues its work more or less as usual (but with some changes in terms of working remotely and only voting with a fewer set of MPs).

# Switzerland 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The emergency situation allows the Federal Council to enact ordinances to mitigate the emergency that the parliament does not need to approve (but which will expire after 6 months if it does not approve it), through the emergency situation as it is regulated in the constitution (Article 185) and the Epidemics Act. The ordinance (number 2) that is the main legal instrument to handle the pandemic is one such ordinance, and also the current Ordninace 3 which contains less provisions, is such an ordinance. Consequently, the constitution and Empidemics Act gives the government a right to narrowly rule by decree (measures must be related to the emergency, and they expire if parliament don't approve them). This is therefore coded as 2 for both periods.

 The parliament was dissolved following the death of three MPs. Neither their deaths or the suspension is officially related to covid-19. Rather, the  dissolvement is because of an upcoming election.

# Togo 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 On March 30, 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus, all the consequent measures taken, including the declaration of the state of emergency, had already been authorized by the National Assembly, and in addition as article 5 of the Law No. 2020-005 mentions, ''During the empowerment period, the Government shall communicate to the National Assembly, at its request, any measure taken or implemented in application of this law.''
 The Law No. 2020-005 clearly lists all the domains and the specific policy areas that the Government may decide on.
Art. 94 of the Constitution also clarifies that the the National Assembly may not be dissolved during the duration of the state of siege or the state of urgency'.

The National Assembly has also taken some social distancing measures.

# Tunisia 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The constitution is vague. Article 70: "...for a limited period not exceeding two months, and for a specific purpose, the Head of Government [can] issue decree-laws of a legislative character, to be submitted for ratification to the Assembly immediately after the end of the period of authorization." Article 80:"In the event of imminent danger threatening the nation's institutions or the security or independence of the country, and hampering the normal functioning of the state, the President of the Republic may take any measures necessitated by the exceptional circumstances, after consultation..." Since aricle 80 has no time limit for how long the President may have these extra powers, and no information has been found that proves that they have ended, the July/September period is coded similarly to the March/June period.

# Turkey 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The Turkish Parliament suspended sessions for six weeks from 16 April to 31 May 2020, with direct reference to Covid-19. Media reported on 26 June that parliament had again shut until 30 June due to the virus. The Turkish constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), but such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued decrees with reference to ordinary laws -- Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies. No evidence has been found of any changes to this practice in relation to emergency measures, and this is therefore coded as 3 in both periods.

*Comments*:
 The National Emergency Act, or related emergency measures taken such as under the Stafford Act and Public Health Service Act, do not provide the executive any additional lawmaking power, nor does it limit the legislatures lawmaking role. The National Emergency Act grants the executive access to a number of emergency authority statutes that can be activated.  Consequently, only already existing statues are made available, not the capacity to without the legislature create new ones.

On 28 July 2020, the legislature adjurned business to 25 August after members of Parliament and staff had tested positive to Covid-19. On 25 August, the parliament sat for only 20 minutes to swear in a new MP. The legislature was further adjourned to 1 September.

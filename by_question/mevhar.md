 Afghanistan's biggest news agency, Pajhwok Afghan News, has been harrassed since it reported on 32 ventilators that were meant for Afghan Covid-19 patients that were stolen and sold to Pakistan. The director of the agency was interrogated by representative from the health ministry the day after the report was released.

 A journalist was threated by a construction worker from a private company after filming violations of the curfew. The source that IPI refers to mentions that the company is favored by the government, but this is not sufficient to classify it as the government's agent. No new information found since June 2020.

 1: On 8 May 2020, Chris Buckley a foreign correspondent with the NYT who spent 76 days in Wuhan reporting on the Covid-19 crisis, was forced out of China on May 8th after the authorities refused to renew his visa. The Australian native, based in China for the past 24 years, was personally attacked in recent months by Chinese state media for his reporting on the epidemic, which included how government secrecy delayed the fight against the virus and public anger over the death of whistleblower, Dr, Li Wenliang.
2: On 27 March 2020 at least 13 US foreign correspondents were forced to leave China. 
I have coded this as verbal harassment as they were asked/forced to leave the country and no physical harm was inflicted upon them.

 'At about 11:00 a.m. on April 2, several unidentified men punched and hit a group of eight reporters at the National Identification Office, a government department that manages citizens’ identification cards, while they were investigating claims that the office was violating COVID-19 guidelines by keeping applicants in close quarters, according to news reports and Robest Dimanche, one of the journalists, who spoke with CPJ in a phone interview. Some of the attackers were wearing t-shirts identifying them as personnel from the National Identification Office, and others were wearing shirts identifying them as employees of the Ministry of the Interior and “Public Security,” according to a complaint filed by the journalists to the public prosecutor’s office, which CPJ reviewed.'' 

There are two more incidents against journalists but are not covid19 related (see source 3)

*Comments*:
 A cartoonist working for a newspaper was verbally attacked and threatened by the authorities and pro-government media. A journalist was verbally attacked and threaten by a TV channel close to the government, after she critisized the emergency measures. According to IPI, " journalists reporting on the reality of the situation inside hospitals are regularly denounced as “scaremongers” by the public service broadcaster." Since the reports appear systemic and I have not found any evidence verbal harassment has stopped, mevhar is coded as 1 in both March-June and July-September 2020 period.

Also: ''Niger police interrogate TV editor and journalist over interview, March 14, 2020: Judicial police in Niger summoned the editor-in-chief and a journalist of Television Labari, following an article the outlet published which interviewed a prominent veterinarian about the COVID-19 pandemic.''

Also: ''In the days before the demonstration, several journalists had been targeted: summoned by the police or arrested after speaking out or for conducting interviews related to the issue of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of them, Mamane Kaka Touda, journalist and human rights defender, is still detained, accused of "disseminating data which may disturb public order" simply for having shared information on the existence of a suspect case.''

# Papua New Guinea 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The Police Minister called for the resignation of two journalists reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, stating that they "can't be trusted" (the minister did not, however, start any investigation or call for arrests). This is deemed a verbal harassment of  these journalists, and thus coded as 1. Furthermore, the National Pandemic Act criminalizes spreading false and misleading information on the public health emergency, which allows for interrogation and arresting of media workers if they have been deemed committing any such offense. While no reports have been found of verbal harassment in the second period, there has not been found any evidence of improvement either. This is therefore coded as 1 for both periods.

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister published a denigrating statement towards journalists in general and the country's two main TV channels on 11 May, as well as accusations of lying and threats over the funding of the country's public TV channel on Twitter on 21-22 March. Blaž Zgaga, a journalist for RSF, was insulted and verbally threatened by the authorities after asking about a new Covid-19 crisis unit. On 2 August, the Acting Director of the Government Communication Office (UKOM) " tweeted urging citizens to report and denounce any media or journalists in Slovenia who “obviously and shamelessly use manipulations” in their work to purposefully mislead people". The statement did not specifically target journalists reporting on Covid-19, it indicates that verbal harassment towards journalists in general is ongoing, which can be seen as evidence that the situation did not improve.

*Comments*:
 There are numerous instances in which the President and his colleagues have verbally harrassed journalists and news agencies. Reporters without borders have published two articles on this, and the verbal harassment of individual journalists and news agencies are widely covered in the press in general, especially those stemming from the President. However, reports of this have only been found in the first period, and this is therefore only coded 1 for this period.
Note also that some journalists have been subject to verbal and physical harassment when covering Black Lives Matter-protests, but these are not regarded here as they are not directly linked to Covid-19.

 Reports of physical assault and detention of several journalists in April 2020. I have not found any new information in July-September 2020. Since cases of physical harassment of journalists are monitored by various sources (Council of Europe, IPI, CPJ) on a case by case bases, lack of information likely means that there were no further cases of physical harrassment.

 A journalist has been arrested and jailed for reporting on a Covid-19 death. This is however the only report found on physical harassment of journalists, and it does seem to be no recurring or systematic practice in relation to Covid-19 reporting. There is therefore not reason to believe that such harassment should have continued into the second period, and it is coded 1 only for the first period.

''Congolese reporter charged with violating Covid-19 restrictions, May 9, 2020
Faustin Mbiya, a journalist at Foundation Daniel Madimba radio station based in Mbuji-Mayi, was arrested on 9 May on his return from producing a broadcast in Tshilenge, 25 km to the east. He was freed on bail of 300,000 Congolese francs (160 euros) on 12 May pending trial on charges of “violating emergency health measures” and “insulting the provincial authorities.”''

''Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) police deliberately ran down television journalist Tholi Totali Glody in Likasi on March 22, 2020, in the country’s Haut-Katanga province of Glody, who works for Alfajari TV, a local station, and who was reporting on compliance to the lockdown decreed by the provincial government.''

Some of the attackers were wearing t-shirts identifying them as personnel from the National Identification Office, and others were wearing shirts identifying them as employees of the Ministry of the Interior and “Public Security,” according to a complaint filed by the journalists to the public prosecutor’s office, which CPJ reviewed.''

 Reports of arrests of journalists covering government's response to the pandemic:  "Kazak authorities arrest two KTK TV journalists reporting on hospital working conditions on April 11, 2020. Police in the western city of Atyrau arrested journalist Beken Alirakhimov and cameraman Manas Sharipov of KTK TV as they were interviewing doctors and reporting on working conditions at a hospital in the city. The pair were charged with “violating the state of emergency” under Article 476 of the Administrative Code. They were found guilty on April 24 and were placed under forced quarantine for two weeks in hospital." (IPI)  Since cases of physical harassment of journalists are monitored by various sources (IPI, CPJ) on a case by case bases, lack of information likely means that there were no further cases of physical harrassment.

 A tv host in Madagascar is detained: ''The TV host placed in pre-trial detention on Wednesday April 8, suspected of spreading false news on social networks concerning the number of cases of coronavirus, is also judged as a simple citizen. "She  was not a journalist and it was not in the course of her work that she was accused,  " insists the minister, who specifies that this host works for a channel which belongs to a minister of the current government.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the two women do not know when the trial will take place and this is what worries all the more Amnesty International and the Union de la Presse Francophone.''

 Two Pakistani journalists were beaten while in detention for three days in Pakistan's Balochistan province. They were reporting on the lack of basic necessities at a coronavirus quarantine centre in June 2020. 

Even though no find specific reports of journalists being harassed were found for the Jul/Sep period, such harassment is common according to various human rights organizations. Therefore mephar is coded as 1 for Jul/Sep.

# Rwanda

*Comments*:
 Journalists have been arrested.

''Journalist and media worker arrested for violating curfew in Rwanda:
Police in Rwanda arrested journalist Dieudonné Niyonsenga and media worker Fidèle Komezusenge for violating the country’s COVID-19 lockdown. Both were on their way to report at the time. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau announced criminal charges on Twitter. Rwanda’s lockdown does not explicitly exempt journalists from moving freely to work.''

Also: ''At least four bloggers were arrested in Rwanda earlier this month for violating the government's directives, as they tried to cover coronavirus lockdown measures, according to Human Rights Watch.''

Also: ''TV director Hassan had notably finished a sensitive report investigating the impact of Rwanda’s lockdown measures on locals in poor districts. “These journalists were asking questions about why authorities were demolishing homes deemed unstable in working class areas without compensating their occupants,” Laurent Munyandilikirwa, head of Rwanda’s Observatory for human rights told RFI. The government argues the measure was to protect inhabitants from torrential rains, but Munyandilikirwa says their homes were never located in flood-prone areas to begin with. “They (the journalists) crossed the red line by seeking the truth,” believes the rights defender, who has urged the government to release any media professional detained for their Covid-19 coverage.''

*Comments*:
 No evidence has been found on there being any physical harassment of journalists reporting on Covid-19 since 11 March in Saudi Arabia (although there is substantial physical harassment of already jailed journalists in Saudi Arabia, but these occurences are not related to Covid-19).  If such harassment has occured, it has not reached Reporters without Borders and the International Press Institutes coverage of the press freedom and journalists situation in Saudi Arabia.  This is therefore coded as 0 for both periods.

Several journalists were physically harassed by the police while covering anti-lockdown protests in July 2020. Although the journalist not directly reporting on Covid-19, it indicates that physical harassment towards journalists in general is ongoing, which can be seen as evidence that the situation has not improved.

 Journalist Fayia Amara was beated by the military as he was reporting on covid-19 quarantine centre on 1 April 2020. The journalist was mob-beaten by 9 military officials, suffered severe injuries and reportedly collapse when he appeared in court. According to the President of the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (a source that IPI and CPJ cite) from a press release in April 2020, "the list of police/military assault on journalists is long", but I found no evidence of other attacks on journalists reported in the media. Since I found no evidence that the situation improved, mephar is coded as 1 during both March-June and July-September 2020.

Note that some journalists have been subject to verbal and physical harassment when covering Black Lives Matter-protests, but these are not regarded here as they are not directly linked to Covid-19.

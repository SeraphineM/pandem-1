*Comments*:
 Afghanistan's biggest news agency, Pajhwok Afghan News, has been harrassed since it reported on 32 ventilators that were meant for Afghan Covid-19 patients that were stolen and sold to Pakistan in June 2020. The director of the agency was interrogated by representative from the health ministry the day after the report was released. After this report, the Vice-President Amrullah Saleh said in a tweet that the ventilators never went missing. 

I did not find addition cases of de-facto limitations on reporting no the government’s response to the pandemic.

# Algeria 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 'Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Algeria headed by newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune approved a bill amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The sweeping new law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.''

Also: In a statement on July 11, the Algerian Minister of Communication accused the media of spreading falsehoods about COVID-19 and threatened jounalists with 5 years imprisonment.

Also: ''One journalist, Khaled Drareni, an editor at the Algerian publication, the Casbah Tribune, was arrested for allegedly "inciting an unarmed gathering and endangering national unity" over his critical Covid-19 coverage. In the past, Drareni had been arrested for his coverage of anti-government protests which had been staged every Friday for more than a year, before it was stopped because of Covid-19.''

*Comments*:
 Media freedom is limited in Angola, since several media outlets are controlled by the government and only a few manage to produce independent and critical reporting. The journalists' union accused the public media of not covering demonstrations against the death of an Angolan doctor by police forces after they detained him for not wearing a mask.

*Comments*:
 In accordance with Decree N 298 (also see melim), the authorities ordered several media outlets to remove or edit information related to covid-19 (both regarding the virus and the government's response).  The media outlets that had to remove information include 1)   https://www.azatutyun.am/a/30501332.html (Armenian version of https://www.rferl.org/) – “At the request of the police, journalist Marine Kharatyan was forced to remove the post from her Facebook page yesterday, where she told that people have recently been called to work in one of the large factories in Yerevan.”
2)     “Hraparak, was forced to retract a story about complaints by prisoners in Armenian jails that they were no longer permitted to receive parcels from family members. ””

3)     “Etchmiadzin resident complaining that she was ill but hadn’t been properly examined.” (FactInfo Editor-in-Chief Sona Truzyan) https://hetq.am/en/article/114899

Since the measures were revised on 24 March and provisions on the removal of information were removed (also see melimend), merepgov is coded as 0 in July-September 2020.

# Azerbaijan 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Detention of journalists who criticized the government's response. Examples include:

1) "On April 13, Ibrahim Vazirov, a freelance journalist and blogger with Kanal24 Internet TV, was arrested in the city of Shirvan, days after police had demanded he delete online reports about COVID-19.According to the Interior Ministry, he was arrested for disobeying a lawful request by the police and detained for 25 days. Vazirov had been producing video reports critical of the quarantine measures."

2) On 13 April, "Reportyor.info journalist Mirsahib Rahiloglu was arrested in Shirvan for "violating quarantine rules" and detained for 30 days.He had also been critical of the local authorities and published interviews with citizens expressing frustration at the lack of financial support during the lockdown"

3)  "On April 9, freelance journalist Natig Izbatov of online news outlet 7gun.az was arrested as he was filming interviews with people about the economic effects of the quarantine during an anti-government protest in Xirdalan, a city near Baku."

Although new information found since June 2020, still coded as 1 as media freedom in Azerbaijan in general is limited.

IPI reports that: "Over the last decade, Aliyev, who has ruled Azerbaijan since 2003 and won every presidential election with around 80 percent of the vote, has gradually tightened his grip over the media space and overseen the persecution of critical journalists and bloggers. Several have fled the country, while those who remain often self-censor for fear of arrest.The country has one of the highest number of journalists in jail in the region. According to IPI research, in addition to those jailed this month [April 2020], five more journalists are currently behind bars."

# Belarus 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Journalist Siarhei Satsuk was detained on 25 March 2020 based on corruption charges after publishing an article critical of the government's response to the pandemic. Although new information was found since June 2020, still coded as 1 as media freedom in Belarus in general is restricted, and independent journalism has been further limited since the 9 August presidential elections. Numerous articles by the IPI and Reporters without Borders on increasing restrictions on press freedom suggest that media faces de-facto limitations on their reporting, which would apply also to reporting on the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, on 29 August 2020 the government withdrew accrediation of 17 journalists working for "Associated Press, AFP, German television network ARD, Deutsche Welle, Reuters, RFE/RL, Radio France International, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal" (IPI). Since 21 August, the government blocked more than 70 websites, including "Radio Svaboda (the Belarusian service of Prague-based Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty), the site of Belsat (a TV channel run by exile journalists based in Warsaw), the Belarusian sites of The Village and Warsaw-based Euroradio, and the Belarusian version of the Russian alternative media outlet MediaZona." (Reporters without borders).

# Benin 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 No explicit de-facto limitations on reporting about the nature of the Covid-19  were found. 

The media however are ''closely watched'', and have been subjected to close surveillance'', and ''pro-government reporting “guidelines” are often sent to the media after cabinet meetings.'' (1)

Also, on July 7, 2020, Benin’s media regulator, the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication (HAAC), has ordered the immediate closure of all “unauthorized” online media outlets. This decision was taken based on article 252 of Law No. 2015-07 of March 20, 2015 on the Information Code in Republic of Benin, according to which ''the direct or indirect operation in the Republic of Benin for free or against payment of a website providing audiovisual communication and print media services intended for the public, is subject to the authorization of the HAAC.'' (see links 6-11). 

After the reactions that this decision provoked, the governemnt made efforts to alleviate the situation and lift the decision to close unauthorized media outlets. (see 12).

# Burma/Myanmar 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Myanmar has used Article 505 of the Penal code, which states that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public" is punishable with up to two years in prison, to arrest and jail a journalist reporting on Covid-19, as well as having closed down over 200 websites by claiming that they have spread "fake news". As the regulation in use allows for any arbitrary interpretation of "fear or alarm to the public" and media outlets online are being closed down, this is deemed a de facto limitation on reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, as doing so risks both being arrested under the penal code and/or being closed down due to spreading fake news. This is therefore coded 1 for both periods.

# Burundi 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 'The final category of African COVID profiles are those countries—Tanzania, Burundi, and Eritrea—that are not actively testing or reporting on their coronavirus cases. As a result, it is very difficult to say with any confidence how seriously the pandemic is affecting these countries.'' (1)
''Burundi’s government is failing to communicate fact-based information on the Covid-19 pandemic and preventing doctors and nurses from responding adequately.'' (2)

There are widepread reports on lack of transparency from the Burundian authoritiies on covid19 related matters.

''A health ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven patients had gone to one hospital with symptoms such as respiratory distress and that a whole wing had been dedicated to them ata military hospital. A doctor, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, reported six deaths of patients “presenting all the symptoms of coronavirus” last week.''

''The UN Commission noted that some humanitarian organisations were refused access to sites where persons were quarantined in deplorable conditions. The quarantined persons should be provided with sufficient food, clean water and access to health facilities and medical services.''

''Human Rights Watch on Tuesday criticized the Burundian government’s performance in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, accusing it of having a “denial and deflection approach to crisis management”.''
'' “On March 27, a hospital in Bujumbura, the country’s economic capital, alerted the government to three strongly suspected cases, who later reportedly tested negative. Several sources in the medical and humanitarian field have expressed concerns to Human Rights Watch that the authorities are not conducting enough tests to understand the extent to which the disease may be spreading,” said the statement.''

Also, the outgoing president of Burundi has died of a sudden illness, suspected by many to be Covid-19. The cause of Pierre Nkurunziza’s death was described as a heart attack in a government statement....It was unclear exactly when he died. A government statement said the president, a keen sports enthusiast, had attended a game of volleyball on Saturday but fell ill that night and was taken to hospital.''

# Cambodia 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 1: The new legislation allows the government to control the press and social media.

2: Art 5(11) of the emergency law provides for “Prohibiting or restricting the distribution or broadcast of information that could generate public alarm or fear or generate unrest, or that could bring about damage to national security, or that could bring into being confusion regarding the state of emergency.” 

3: Monoroom.info, a Khmer-language news website based in France, became inaccessible in Cambodia on 31 March after it published several articles about the coronavirus situation there. It has remained inaccessible ever since.

The laws and governments increased ability to control the press would hinder the journalists’ abilities to be critical on the government’s response to Covid-19.

 Overall, reporters in Chad are often arrested because of what they write. There exist charges on defamation, and cyber-censorship. Journalists are exposed to the threat of terrorism, and have also been subjected to violence by the security forces. (RSF)

''On 26 March, journalist for state broadcaster Télé Tchad Aly Mahamat Bello, his cameraman Abakar Mahamad Seid and their driver were assaulted and then detained by the Chad Police Mobile Intervention Unit (GMIP) in the capital, N’Djamena, while reporting on government Covid-19 enforcement measures (coronavirus-related restrictions on public gatherings). The Union of Chadian Journalists said the three were interrogated for three hours before being released.''

 There has been restrictions on the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

1: Ruth Michaelson, a journalist with The Guardian who had been living and working in Egypt had to leave the country after she reported on research by infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto as well as public health data and news stories that pointed to Egypt having a higher rate of coronavirus cases than reported by the government.

2: In March, security forces arrested an Egyptian journalist for questioning official statistics in relation to the spread of COVID-19 on his personal Facebook page. He was held at an undisclosed location without any contact with the outside world for nearly a month before being brought in front of prosecutors to face accusations of “spreading false news” and “joining a terrorist organization”.

3: Doctors and pharmacists have been arrested for speaking out against the government’s response to the virus.

4: At least ten doctors and six journalists have been arrested between February and July 2020. Health workers have also been instructed to refrain from discussing the situation regarding Covid-19 with the press. The Supreme Council has also made multiple announcements threatening legal action against members of the media who report on the government's response to Covid-19 in a negative manner.

Journalists and editors in Gabon report that this lack of granted authorizations poses a problem for them reporting in the field (2).

Authorities in Gabon have extended the country's State of Health Emergency measures for 45 days from Aug. 14, 2020. A nightly 2000-0500 curfew remains in effect.

In addition, the media in Gabon are facing serious government censorship (6). The role of HAC (High Authority of Communication) in particular has been extremely problematic the last years (4, 5), suspending several media and newspapers. Although these developments related to facts before Covid19, it is nevertheless a problem which relates to the current situation and still exists.

 'Journalists have also faced obstacles while reporting on the coronavirus pandemic.
In April, the CPJ called on Haitian authorities to investigate an assault on a group of journalists in Port-au-Prince. CPJ reported that several unidentified men punched and hit a group of eight reporters at the National Identification Office, a government department that manages citizens’ identification cards. The journalists were there to report on claims that the office was not adhering to guidelines on social distancing.
“Journalists should be free to cover COVID-19 and local authorities’ handling of the pandemic without fear that they will be assaulted,” said CPJ Central and South America Program Coordinator Natalie Southwick.

*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 There are several restrictions to media in Hong Kong, especially through the National Security Law imposed on June 30. In the period Mar/Jun, the media in Hong Kong faced multiple limitations in its reporting, for example illustrated by the arrest of media owner Jimmy Lai in April. While these restrictions mainly pertained to the pro-democracy protests, it is here regarded as constituting such overall limitations that reporting on the governments reponse to Covid-19 should be affected as well. And after the implementation of the National Security Law, which criminalizes speech and press that could "interfere", "disrupt" or "undermine" the Hong Kong and Chinese government, this constitutes an even greater de facto limitation on media. This is therefore coded as 1 for both periods.

 There have not been government placed de-facto limitations on media reporting. However, On April 4, 2020, the National Police Headquarter issued a Telegram Letter instructing the police on the handling of “hoax spreaders” and any act of insult to the President and his administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the police authority, this telegram letter is officially aimed at maintaining the security and order of the community. The telegram ordered the police force to carry out cyber patrols to monitor developments in cyberspace and to counter criminal acts to provide a deterrent effect. 

So far, there have been at least 53 people accused of spreading “false news” and insulting the President and his administration related to COVID-19. There are concerns on the possibility of criminalization towards more people who spread “false and misleading” information as well as criticize the Government’s response to COVID-19.

 There are several reports on journalists being arrested for reporting on the coronavirus, especially those who have published evidence that contradicts the governments figures about the spread of the virus and accused the Iranian government of misinformation about the Covid-19 situation in Iran. These Journalists have generally been accused of "Publishing false information about the coronavirus". A newspaper was also shut down for publishing an interview with an official working in Iran's Covid-19 Taskforce. Since this reporting includes the prevalence of the virus, this is included in the government response, and therefore coded as 1.

 There are several reports of journalsits being arrested and detained for investigating and reporting on Covid-19, for example its prevalence and protests held in relation to emergency measures. In early April 2020, the commission suspended Reuters license and fined it 25 million IQD (US$21,000) for an April 2 article alleging that the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country was much higher than official statistics indicated. The authorities lifted the suspension on April 19. The Reuters report, published on April 2, cited three doctors involved in the testing process, a health ministry official and a senior political official as saying Iraq had thousands of confirmed COVID-19 cases, many times more than the 772 it had publicly reported at that time. There are also vaguely formulated defamation laws and similar regulation that Iraqi authorities can prosecute media and individuals of breaking,  that constitutes a de facto limitation. This is therefore coded as 1.

 'In Côte d’Ivoire, two journalists were fined 5 million CFA francs (7,620 euros) each on charges of “spreading false news” for reporting that there were two coronavirus cases in Abidjan’s main prison, a claim denied by the prison authorities.''

Also, ''RSF registered few press freedom violations in Côte d’Ivoire in 2019 but police attacks on journalists, especially during demonstrations, have continued and testify to the need for more awareness training about journalists’ rights.''

 There are reports of journalists being arrested for reporting criticism on the governments response to Covid-19. Furthermore, the Jordanian media has faced additional limitations in July and August when government has cracked down on their coverage of protests against the government. While not directly related to Covid-19, it shows that media faces several limitations in reporting on and criticizing the government, and this is therefore coded as 1 for both periods.

# Kyrgyzstan 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 No information on limitation of media reporting on the government's response.  Nevertheless, the government has placed many limitations on media reporting in general.

According to Human Rights Watch, In Kyrgyzstan, neither independent media outlets nor lawyers have been granted permits to pass police checkpoints, interfering with their ability to do their jobs"; Kyrgyzstan has " threatened criminal sanctions or opened investigations into people for spreading “false information” about the virus, including doctors concerned about inadequate protective equipment." "in Kyrgyzstan, Human Rights Watch found that the State Committee on National Security (GKNB) either posted or distributed among media outlets photographs and personal information of at least 27 people it accused of “spreading knowingly false information” about the virus. In most cases, the agency said that the person was released after apologizing to the public, but that the agency “reminds people that spreading false information provides for criminal liability."

# Laos 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
This puts a strong de facto limitation on media reporting on the governments response to Covid-19 in Laos, by making it  punishable to report  on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any de facto limitations on media reporting about  Covid-19 in Lebanon,  and no other indications have been found of there having been implemented any such limitations. However, the state of emergency imposed after the Beirut explosion introduce far reaching powers for the government that could possibly limit media, and Lebanese media do face other restrictions, for example through defamation laws (an introduction of these can be found in this HRW report: https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/15/there-price-pay/criminalization-peaceful-speech-lebanon)  This is coded 0, as no evidence has been found that existing or new measures having limited reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, but it should be noted that the media seem to face limitations in other aspects.

*Comments*:
 Apart from the de-jure  limitations already imposed, in Madagascar the authorities have banned radio phone-in programmes in which listeners could express their views about the pandemic and the way the government is dealing with it.

''Amnesty International calls on the authorities to stop using the measures to address COVID-19 as a pretext to sanction media outlets, opposition figures or anyone critical of the government’s actions. The authorities must ensure full and effective respect for the human rights of everyone, including the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and media freedom.'' (1)

Another report accused Madagascan government on an act of sabotage that has silenced an opposition TV channel and to guarantee journalistic freedom.

''Publishing director and journalist at the Ny Valosoa newspaper Arphine Helisoa was arrested and put in pre-trial detention on 4 April after she was accused of criticizing the president’s handling of the national response to COVID-19 in an article. She is still in detention in Antanimora prison in the country’s capital Antananarivo. She was charged with spreading fake news and incitement of hatred towards President Andry Rajoelina.''

More incidents mentioned in the articles linked.

*Comments*:
 In May, a journalist received a fine after reporting on "unsafe working conditions and lack of disinfectant inside their textile factory during Covid-19" in a textile factory on Facebook (since she is a journalist, making a social media post is considered journalism). As IDEA reports, "Journalist Natalia Cebotari was intimidated, harassed, and fined 123 euro over a Facebook post reporting on unsafe and unhygienic working conditions in a textile factory. She also faced pressure from authorities to reveal her sources."

 IPI reports that "the country’s Security and Intelligence Service (SIS) also ordered 52 different websites allegedly disseminating fake news about the coronavirus to be blocked." The official press release says that the blocked websites are not officially registered news agencies and contains no other information on the content, therefore this is not considered in the coding.

# Mongolia

*Comments*:
 Mongolia amended the Law on Administrative Offenses to include a paragraph stating that: "Misleading the public or disseminating false information in the event of a disaster, catastrophe, communicable disease, accident or danger shall be punishable by a fine of 500 000 togrogs for a person or 5 000 000 togrogs for a legal person unless criminally punishable" (Section 5.13.1).
As "false information" is poorly defined, and this law is being enacted and journalists and media outlets face the risk of being prosecuted for "disseminating false information", this is coded as 1, a de facto limitation on reporting on the governments response to Covid-19 is made as journalists and media outlets now that they can be fined on a vaguely formulated regulation on disinformation.
Since the law is still in place, this is coded 1 for both periods.

# Morocco 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 With the Emergency Laws, there are limitations in media reporting during the pandemic. Also, Morocco's media face judicial harassment, and many journalists and citizen-journalists continue to be imprisoned, in light of covid19.

''Since its adoption, the authorities have used the new law to prosecute at least five human rights activists and citizen journalists, accusing them of “incitement to violate the authorities’ decisions during the health emergency....“The Moroccan authorities’ introduction of prison sentences to punish those who break confinement or curfew is a disproportionate one. In all cases, this flawed law should never be used to silence the voices of those daring to criticize the government’s measures and handling of the pandemic.” (2)

''The decree enables the government to declare a ""state of health emergency"" and take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).''

In a statement on March 22, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news. (the statement is found in the link in arabic)"

 The government is not transparent about the situation and does not share the real number of cases, deaths, or tests. There were police officers by the hospitals to prevent journalists from filming or speaking with health professionals. Several burials happened during the night, so citizens wouldn't know and journalists could not report about them. Additionally, the government has blocked independent media from participating in press conferences.

*Comments*:
 ...''there has been little change in the overall environment for the media and journalists. In a regional context marked by the fight against terrorism, visits by journalists to the most dangerous areas are still limited, and it is very hard to get information about terrorism or migration. Both Niger's authorities and certain international organizations are responsible for the restrictions on the release of information.'' (RSF)

''on March 25 2020, Kaka Touda, an independent journalist who publishes news reports on his Facebook and Twitter pages, In Niger's capital Niamey, was arrested for his social media post about a suspected Coronavirus case in a local hospital, which filed a complaint against him. The hospital said in the complaint that the March 4 social media post posed a threat to law and order.''
Also: ''Niger police interrogate TV editor and journalist over interview, March 14, 2020: Judicial police in Niger summoned the editor-in-chief and a journalist of Television Labari, following an article the outlet published which interviewed a prominent veterinarian about the COVID-19 pandemic.''

*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 I did not find information on de-facto limitations on media reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic in North Korea. 

However, North Korea is notorious for its highly controlled media prior to the pandemic. North Koreans can be sent to concentration camps for viewing, reading or listening to content provided by media outlets outside the country. As the information coming into the country is also very strictly controlled, it would be difficult for North Koreans to compare responses and form an opinion on the North Korean government’s response towards the pandemic.

Independant media is prohibited and the government regularly uses arrest, punishment of crimes and torture in custody and executions to maintain fear and contol over the population. 

These restrictions which have been in place since before the pandemic, would act as de-facto limitations on the ability of the media to report on the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

 Two Pakistani journalists were beaten while in detention for three days in Pakistan's Balochistan province. They were reporting on the lack of basic necessities at a coronavirus quarantine centre in June 2020. 

This coupled with the continued crackdown on press freedom and dissenting voices in Pakistan could cause the media to face continued de-facto limitations on reporting on the government’s response to the pandemic.

*Comments*:
 PNG passed the National Pandemic Act which under Section 47 states that ”A person commits an offense if the person … knowingly gives false or misleading information, or … recklessly disseminates false or misleading information to the public in relation to a Public Health Emergency”. Being found guilty of any of the offenses under Section 47 (which includes other offenses as well) can result in penalties of fines up to 50 000 Kina, and imprisonment for up to five years. 
This clearly constitutes a limitation to reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, and is coded 1 for both periods.

 Coded as 1 due to wide media censorship. According to Reporters without Borders, Qatar has a "draconian system of censorship" and reporting on sensitive topics can result in imprisonment. Freedom House reports that all journalists "practice a degree of self-censorship", so it is likely that journalists faced limitations on reporting on the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

 (RSF) ''Journalists pressured to censor themselves: 
The country seems pluralistic but this is just a facade. There is a score of privately-owned TV stations, a similar number of newspapers and around 40 radio stations, but all are under strong pressure to censor themselves and many are owned by government allies. Since 2014, several journalists have been threatened, forced to flee the country or summarily deported for criticizing the government or inviting opposition politicians to express their views. During the 2016 presidential election, the Internet was disconnected to prevent journalists and activists from verifying and challenging the results.''

State TV anchor in Congo suspended after asking a minister 'inconvenient question'' about COVID-19 pandemic
''Rocil Otouna was discreetly sidelined as news anchor after putting some difficult questions about the coronavirus crisis to the justice minister in an interview two weeks ago. Otouna has not been seen on the air since 30 April, when he asked the minister about the lack of information about coronavirus victims, including those currently ill and those who have recovered, and about contradictions between the government's figures and those given by the president on both the caseload and the lockdown's economic and social consequences.''

# Russia 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 According to Reporters without Border, at the end of March "the regional online newspaper Magadan Govorit was forced to delete a story at the start of the week about the death of a patient suspected of having the virus who finally tested negative. The newspaper said its information was reliable and verified, and did not give the cause of death. Roskomnadzor nonetheless insisted on its deletion." 

According to CPJ, "On June 9, a court in the central Russian city of Ufa fined Timur Almaev, chief editor of independent news website ProUfu, 60,000 rubles ($862) after the outlet published a story alleging that one thousand graves were dug in Ufa for possible victims of COVID-19... police in the town of Sivirsky, outside St. Petersburg, questioned Tatyana Voltskaya, a reporter with the U.S. Congress-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, over an April 11 report for the broadcaster that alleged hospitals lacked the supplies to respond to the pandemic. Authorities opened an investigation into that article on April 25, and allege that Voltskaya was “spreading false news,” she said. If charged and convicted, she could face a fine and up to five years in jail under the Russian criminal code." 

The government passed ammendments to Article 207 of Criminal Code (on spreading disinformation) which was used to censor reporting on the government's handling of the pandemic.  According to IPI, "On March 19, the country’s media regulatory agency, Roskomnadzor, which has a history of censoring the independent press, demanded that more than 20 media outlets remove content it deemed “inaccurate, socially significant information” about the coronavirus from their websites. Among them was radio station Echo of Moscow, which was pressured to remove the recording and transcript of an interview with a disease expert who criticized the government’s handling of the health crisis." Moreover, "media outlets will also be fined up to €117,000 if they publish disinformation about the outbreak, raising further concerns that the broadly defined law will be used to target media that criticize the government’s response to the outbreak." Based on this information (also see melim), merepgov s coded as 1 during both March-June and July-September 2020.

# Rwanda 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures and particularly the lockdown of March 21 (1) did not exempt journalists from moving freely to work, as it did not include the media in the essential services that are exempted from the movement restrictions (1). The lockdown was eased in May, but after a rise in coronavirus cases it is since then being re-imposed in selected areas.

Also, the media system is facing cernsorship:
...''censorship is ubiquitous and self-censorship is widely used to avoid running afoul of the regime...''

''Journalist and media worker arrested for violating curfew in Rwanda:
Police in Rwanda arrested journalist Dieudonné Niyonsenga and media worker Fidèle Komezusenge for violating the country’s COVID-19 lockdown. Both were on their way to report at the time. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau announced criminal charges on Twitter. Rwanda’s lockdown does not explicitly exempt journalists from moving freely to work.''

Also: ''At least four bloggers were arrested in Rwanda earlier this month for violating the government's directives, as they tried to cover coronavirus lockdown measures, according to Human Rights Watch.''

Also: ''TV director Hassan had notably finished a sensitive report investigating the impact of Rwanda’s lockdown measures on locals in poor districts. “These journalists were asking questions about why authorities were demolishing homes deemed unstable in working class areas without compensating their occupants,” Laurent Munyandilikirwa, head of Rwanda’s Observatory for human rights told RFI. The government argues the measure was to protect inhabitants from torrential rains, but Munyandilikirwa says their homes were never located in flood-prone areas to begin with. “They (the journalists) crossed the red line by seeking the truth,” believes the rights defender, who has urged the government to release any media professional detained for their Covid-19 coverage.''

 While no reports have been found on specific instances or measures of censoring or other limitations of the media reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, the already existing, strong limitations on media in Saudi Arabia should constitute a significant de facto limitation on them reporting on Covid-19.

 The curfew in Senegal was implemented by quota, i.e the schedule would vary over time (see 2, 3), and the government did not manage to issue authorization for exemption from the restrictions to all journalsists and media, preventing them therefore from accessing information and reporting in the field.
The state of emergency and the related curfew -which affected media - were lifted in Senegal on June 30, 2020.

''The Ministry of the Interior was unable to issue exemptions to all the media and all the journalists who requested this document which allows them to circulate during the curfew "the distribution was made by quota" comments Bamba Kassé, the general secretary of the Senegalese journalists' union.''

*Comments*:
 Journalist Fayia Amara was beated by the military as he was reporting on covid-19 quarantine centre on 1 April 2020. The journalist was mob-beaten by 9 military officials, suffered severe injuries and reportedly collapse when he appeared in court. This level of brutality would likely discourage other journalists to report on the government's response to Covid-19. According to the President of the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (a source that IPI and CPJ cite) from a press release in April 2020, "the list of police/military assault on journalists is long", but I found no evidence of other attacks on journalists reported in the media. Since I found no evidence that the situation improved, merepgov is coded as 1 during both March-June and July-September 2020.

# Singapore 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) was introduced enacted on 1 April 2019. This law allows members of the government to control information circulating online. The law allows every government minister to issue directives to censor, correct or block access to online content that the government deems to be the “in the public interest”. 

This law has been used to correct several posts that have been made by the public on both the prevalence and to critic the government’s response to Covid-19.

1: POFMA was invoked against five online media platforms after these media platforms used statements from Paul Tambyah, an opposition politician and infectious diseases expert in a forum at the National University of Singapore. This correction direction was issued after he accused the ministerial committee in charge of tackling Covid-19 of losing their focus on public health and instead prioritising the upcoming general election that was carried out in July 2020.

 Blaž Zgaga, a journalists, mentions that "officials in the new government have targeted him and other journalists over their criticism of the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic" in an interview with CPJ, but I have not found any evidence of factual cases where journalists faced limitations on media reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic, therefore coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 1: While there hasn’t been measures on media freedom with regards to journalists and mainstream media, the Acting Inspector General (IGP) instructed the police to take legal action against those who publish posts on social media criticising government officials and obstructing their duties. The police have not indicated under what legal provision these actions will be taken. The police reportedly arrested more than seven individuals in the week after this order came into place. As of April 17 the police had reportedly arrested 17 individuals ‘for spreading false information’ about COVID-19. None of these people were journalists.

2: Sri Lanka's media environment has been heavily controlled and censored before the pandemic. Several activists and journalists have been warned that they are on the government 'watch lists'.

3: Journalists have also fled the country. An example is Dharisha Bastians. The former editor of the Sunday Observer  left Sri Lanka after her telephone records were publicized and her laptop seized by the authorities.

Media reporting has been further limited due to new regulations on "false information" (see melim).

 The Mwananchi newspaper was banned from publishing online and and fined 5 million shillings, for 6 months, for having reported critically about the president's actions during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Three TV operators - Star Media, Multichoice Tanzania and Azam Digital Broadcast - were fined and were ordered to broadcast an apology for seven days in a row for carrying a report that described the President as 'stubborn' for refusing to impose a general lockdown. 

On 10 August, the Tanzanian government announced that broadcasting foreign content would be banned without government permission. This includes content about Covid-19. The government effectively controls the information that is published.

*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Thailand's media landscape has been restricted since before the pandemic. Government critics have been punished by draconian legislation. 

1: Any information about the virus that the government deems to be ”false or capable of causing fear in the public” is not punishable by up to five years in prison. There is also no definition of what constitutes ‘false’ information.

2: A journalist was sentenced to two years in jail in December 2019 after tweeting about the appalling living conditions of migrant workers in the country. Incidents like these would create a highly self-censored environment where de-facto limitations on reporting about the government's reponse to the pandemic would exist.

 Both Amnesty International and Reporters without borders report that several journalists have been arrested and charged, and media outlets being censored, as a result of them reporting on Covid-19 and how its spreading, and accusing the Turkish government of giving incorrect figures of the number of cases and spread of the virus in Turkey. While these reports are of events occurring in the previous period, this constitutes a de facto limitation in the current period as well, since it sends a clear message what happens if media outlets and journalists report news on the governments response to Covid-19 that the government does not wish them to report. Therefore, this is coded as 1 for both periods.

 Coded as 1 due to wide censorship of domestic media outlets. According to Reporters without Borders, "Ranked last in RSF's 2019 World Press Freedom Index, Turkmenistan is one of the world's most closed countries. The government controls all domestic media and continues to step up its persecution of those who clandestinely report for exile media outlets. The few Internet users can only access a highly-censored version of the Internet, usually in cafes where they must first present identification."

According to Human Rights Watch, "The Turkmen government routinely retaliates against independent reporting inside the country."

# Vietnam 
*Time period: Mar-Jun*: 1

 
*Time period: Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Vietnam's media is heavily censored and follows the communist party's orders. The sources of independently reported information are bloggers and independent journalists who are aubjected to harsh forms of punishment. This would make it challenging for journalists to be critical of the government's response to the pandemic.

A new decree was introduced in Vietnam on 15 April 2020 introducing fines for the dissemination of ‘fake news’ or rumours on social media. According to the decree, fines are imposed on people who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted or slanderous information.  At least two Facebook users have been given criminal sentences for sharing information deemed to be fake about the virus. The criminal sentences have been up to nine months detention and fines over USD$1000. These restrictions may also contribute to a climate of fear and self-censorship in reporting.

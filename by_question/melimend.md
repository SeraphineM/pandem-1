# Hungary 
*Answer*: 2020-06-17 

*Comments*:
 For the duration of the state of emergency that was lifted on 17 June 2020. The law on misinformation (see melim) was added to the Penal Code and was declared not unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court, meaning that it would apply if a state of emergency is declared again. It does not apply during the state of epidemiological preparedness (in place at the time of coding), therefore melimend is same as emend.

# Lesotho 

*Answer:* *No answer entered* 

*Comments*:
 Limits on media reporting started with the declaration of the state of emergency and the impositon of the lockdown.
The lockdown however, along with other provisions, was eased on May 5th, 2020 (Legal Notice n.41 of 2020.05.05 - see source 2), but a clause regarding fake news was still in place under the section ''Offences and Penalties'':
Paragraph 12, section (6): ''No person shall publish or spread fake or false information....''
This provision continued to be in place in later revisions/updates of the covid19 measures: see legal notice no.68 of August 26, 2020 - source -3-).

 The media limitations are made under the authority of the declaration of State of Emergency (articles 85, 86, 87, and 88 of the constitution), which allows the President to "suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees" during a State of Emergency. The date is the end date for the State of Emergency declaration (variable emlimitdate).

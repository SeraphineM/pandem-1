# Algeria 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Algeria adopted several gradual measures through decrees. The decrees are based on the Constitution (1) and other legal acts, but the articles on which they are based are not related to emergency powers, but rather to ''normal'' lawming powers. 
For example, the decrees  No. 20-69 of March 21 2020 (2), and 20-70 of March 24 2020 (3) refer legally to the Constitution, articles 99 (4) and 143 (1), or the law n° 88-07 du 7 Joumada Ethania 1408 correspondant au 26 janvier 1988 relative à l’hygiène, à la sécurité et à la médecine du travail (4).

''Faced with the Covid-19 health crisis and the development of cases affecting the country, the Algerian Government has gradually taken a series of general measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus. These measures have been the subject of two main texts:
Executive Decree No. 20-69 of March 21, 2020 (2) relating to measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) and, the purpose of which is to establish measures of social distancing intended to prevent and combat the spread of COVID-19; 
 
Executive Decree No. 20-70 of March 24, 2020 (3) establishing additional measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) and which has as its object the establishment of containment devices, restriction of circulation, framing of citizens' trade and supply activities, of rules of distancing as well as the methods of citizen mobilization in the national effort to prevent and combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.''

# Australia 
*Answer*: 2

# Austria 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Austria has a state of emergency legislation, but this has not been used. Instead, Austria have implemented a set of new laws (Covid-19 Law, Second Covid-19 Law and then subsequent legislation for the reopening of Austria) within the existing legal framework. Through the new laws, the government has been given an extraordinary set of powers to address Covid-19, and this is therefore coded as 4.

# Azerbaijan 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 A special quarantine regime but not a state of emergency declared by the Cabinet of Ministers on 24 March 2020. Under the special quarantine regime, people over 65 years old were prohibited from leaving home and assembly of more than 10 people was prohibited. According to OSCE report, Azerbaijan is among countries that "mainly relied on existing sanitation, health
safety and/or disaster legislation that gives the authority to put in place restrictive measures." Note on sources: the links from the official government website (https://cabmin.gov.az/) do not work as of 1 September 2020 due to the expiration of the website's security certificate, so they were replaced with links from the official covid-19 website.

# Bangladesh 
*Answer*: 7 

*Comments*:
 Bangladesh did not declare a state of emergency. It instead declared a country-wide "general holiday", which was imposed for two weeks from 26 March. This was later extended until 5 May. The scope of the "general holiday" was extensive with the closure of all government and private offices, schools and universities and subject to stringent exceptions, all courts including the Supreme Court. 

Whenever any new COVID-19 case is detected, the concerned suburb, village or district is placed under "lockdown" which is often done by an oral administrative order, so it is possible to have both a "public holiday" and also a "lockdown" as emergency measures taken at  the same time.

# Belarus 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 No state of emergency declared and the measures included: Resolution of the Council of Ministers 208 from 8 April 2020 that resticted people in self-isolation from leaving their home and Resolution of the Council of Ministers 171 from 25 March 2020 (amended on 24 April 2020, 26 June 2020) establishing rules for transport operators and people arriving from certain foreign countries (the list of countries that do not require self-isolation was last amended on 11 June 2020). On 24 April, the President signed a decree introducing measures to support the economy. According to OSCE report, such regulations are of "rather limited scope". According to OECD, Belarus has introduced only some containment measures and no "comprehensive containment measures".  Nevertheless, I coded them as part of the emergency response similar to International IDEA.

# Belgium 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Belgium invoke Article 1d05 of the Constitution that gives Special powers to the executive in order to pass legislation dealing with Covid19 (1; 2; 3).
Based on the above, two covid19 laws were passed: Article 3 of Law COVID-19 (I) (No 1104/5), and Article 5 of Law COVID-19 (II) (No 1104/6). 
However, before these two main legal instruments there were a series of laws for the first measures: On 13 March, a ministerial decree signed by the Interior Minister prohibited a number of cultural, recreational and sporting activities, while also closing down schools and restaurants, inter alia. Stricter measures were introduced by ministerial decrees on 18 March and 23 March (including social distancing, distance learning and teleworking for non-essential business); these were further clarified on 24 March and modified on 17 April.

*Comments*:
 Beninese government implemented different measures gradually, but these did not apply to the whole territory (no national-level response). The first 11 measures that we taken at the Council of Ministers on march 17, 2020, were general in nature and applied to the national level. Also, their duration was indefinite. But the more ''strict'' measures, i.e. the covid19 health cordon , applied to the affected areas. 

Health cordon: taken on March 23, is established to count from Monday March 30, 2020 at 00h, a sanitary cordon around the municipalities most exposed to the pandemic that are Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro-Missérété and Adjarra to isolate them from the rest of the country. 

''On April 14, more municipalities were added to the health cordon: After the evaluation of the measures taken by the Government as part of the response to the CORONAVIRUS pandemic (Covid-19), the cordon cordon established as of March 30, 2020 is maintained until Monday April 27, 2020 at midnight.''

''The said cordon is extended to new localities and now includes the following municipalities: Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Tori-Bossito, Kpomassè, Toffo, Zè, Sô-Ava, Aguégués, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro -Missérété, Adjara, and Atchoukpa (municipality of Avrankou).''

# Cameroon 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister of Cameroon announced with a Special declaration on March 17, 2020, a total of thirteen measures after a crisis meeting organized at the palace.
No decree issued, nor any legal instrument was used / invoked to pass the measures.

''In Cameroon, emergency law is solely the prerogative of the President of the Republic. He alone can declare a state of emergency “when circumstances so warrant” or a state of siege “in the event of a serious threat to the nation’s territorial integrity or to its existence, its independence or institutions” (Article 9 of the Constitution). So far, Cameroon’s government has not declared a state of emergency.

Apart from these exceptional powers of the President of the Republic prescribed in the constitution, there is no emergency legal framework applicable in the event of a health emergency....Cameroon could, as has been done in many countries, fill this vacuum by adopting a legal framework tailored to the situation and which could possibly be used to manage future situations. It has not, however, as of yet.

Instead, Cameroon has chosen to base the fight against COVID-19 on its existing legal framework. The fight against COVID-19 is a public health issue which, according to Cameroonian law, is a component of public order. The protection of public order is the responsibility of executive authorities, which have the power to adopt any executive orders for its preservation. As of now, all the measures taken in the context of the fight against COVID-19 are administrative measures, but as we shall see, they have different legal qualities and force.'' (1)

# Canada 
*Answer*: 6 

*Comments*:
 Canada has a state of emergency law, the Emergency Act, but this has not been activated. Instead, the government uses existing legal framework such as the Quarantine Act, Human Pathongen and Toxins Act, Public Health Act and Public Health Agency of Canada Act to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. Furthermore, they have approved laws relating to Covid-19 (Covid-19 Emergency Response Act 1 and 2) but these are not emergency measures that affect any democratic rights, but only provide financial aid to different sectors and groups. The emergency response, and declarations of states of emergency, have instead been conducted more or less entirely at the provincial level. Therefore, this is coded as 6, i.e. they have no national level emergency response because that response is handled by the provinces.

# Central African Republic 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 Central African Republic took a series of gradual measures, without a specific reference to a legal instrument. The measures were announced through Press Releases.

''It was also highlighted that the Government seemed to refer to the Constitution primarily for electoral purposes instead of invoking it for addressing the country's urgent needs due to the disastrous impact of COVID-19.  The Constitution indeed authorises the President to declare a state of emergency or use 'exceptional powers' in exceptional circumstances. Declaring a state of emergency would have allowed the National Assembly to enact a public health emergency law to address the effects of the pandemic. However, the government did not make use of these provisions - or any specific law - as a basis for the de facto emergency measures that it imposed on the population.''

# China 
*Answer*: 6 

*Comments*:
 China has a four-tier response system for public health emergencies that determines what measures a region will implement, with level I the most serious. Officials in the different regions are separately in charge of their own areas. The emergency response law is triggered when the region goes into level 1. However, the measures that can be taken according to the emergency response law is very vague (Third source link). These laws have been enacted since January 2020.

# Croatia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Emergency measures (suspension of social gatherings, closing of restaurants, closing of non-essential stores, border closing etc.) were announced on 19 March 2020, without declaring a state of emergency or disaster. On 21 March 2020, the Civil Protection Headquarters announced a prohibition of gathering in public places for 30 days. On 23 March 2020, the Civil Protection Headquarters announced measures that  "prohibits individuals from leaving their place of residence without a special permit, to be issued for very limited cases"  ("Odluka o zabrani napuštanja mjesta prebivališta i stalnog boravka u Republici Hrvatskoj"). All the measures are new decisions based on existing legislation (Article 22a of the Civil Protection Act). Since the decision from 23 March 2020 constitutes the largest "state of exception", it is considered the primary legal instrument.

# France 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 On Monday March 23, 2020, the French Parliament adopted an emergency law establishing a “health state of emergency,” declared for a period of two months from March 24, 2020 to May 24, 2020 (Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of March 23, 2020 to deal with the Covid-19 epidemic) (the “Emergency Law”). (6)

''The French Constitution (1958) and primary law deals with emergency situations by virtue of three sets of provisions, i) 'presidential exceptional powers' (Article 16 of the Constitution), ii) the 'state of siege' (Article 36 of the Constitution and Article L. 2121-1 of the Defence Code),  and iii) the 'state of emergency' (Law No 55-385 of 1955). 

Despite this existing legal framework, the Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of March 23, 2020 is new legislation. This law adds several provisions to the nation’s Public Health Code (8) , allowing the executive to declare a “state of health emergency” (état d’urgence sanitaire) in all or part of the country, and defining what that entails. A state of health emergency allows the government to severely curtail certain liberties in order to fight a pandemic or similar public health emergency. ''
The new Emergency Law is temporary, and it is due to expire entirely by April 1, 2021. It also needs the approval of the legislature if it is going to be implemented for more than 1 month.

''These provisions supplement a preexisting article of the Public Health Code, article 3131-1, which allows the minister of health to order “any measure proportionate to the risks and appropriate to the circumstances … to prevent and limit the consequences” of a serious health threat to the population. This provision was considered inadequate on its own to deal with a crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, as it placed almost the entire burden of the response on the minister of health. The new provisions, by contrast, are meant to create a more solid and comprehensive framework that involves the entire government.'' (5)

# Gabon 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Gabon declared a state of emergency on April 10, 2020, according to the Constitution (1) (art25 on the state of emergency or seige),  and the law n°11/90 of 16 November 1990 on the state of emergency (2), with the decree n°00100/PR/PM of April 10 2020. (3, 4).
On 11 May the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law (based on Constitution, article 47) allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. The law gives the government similar powers as a state of emergency for an additional 45 days. Under the new law, the state of emergency continued, although under a different legal instrument (Constitution, but provision that gives special powers to the executive). (5)

# Germany 
*Answer*: 6 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures taken toward Covid-19 are primarly done by the German states, and the federal government acts as a coordinating unit. Furthermore, the German constitution includes a state of emergency-clause,  but this has not been activated (different types of states of emergency has however been enacted at the state level). The main emergency measures have been taken under the Infectious Diseases Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz), which is a federal law, but the adoption of the measures is taken by the states under this Law, not the federal government. It is worth noting that the federal government has taken several measures, not least in subsequently ammending the Infectious Diseases Act and also passing financial aid packages, but the primary emergency response exists at the state level, and this is therefore coded as 6.

# Greece 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The greek Constitution (1) has provisions for giving extraordinary powers to the executive in emergency situations other than war (art 44). To deal with the pandemic, the greek government invoked art 44 of the Constitution, which gives the executive the power to ''fast-track'' law-making, through the so-called ''Acts of Legislative Content''. These Acts need parliamentary approval after their issuance, and are usually accompanied by the so-called ''Common Ministerial Decisions'' (KYA in greek), which are government decisions that specify in more detail the general measures taken with the Acts.

# Haiti 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Haiti declared a state of health emergency on March 19, 2020 for a period of one month through an executive decree (1; 2). 
The President is ruling by decree since January 2020, because the elections that were supposed to take place in October 2019 were not held, therefore the mandate of the Haitian legislature expired on January 13, 2020, and ever since no legislature exists (7). 
The Constitution has a clause on states of emergency but there wasn't any legal reference to it in the measures taken (8).

# Hong Kong 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Hong Kong has a type of state of emergency legislation called Emergency Regulations Ordinance (for example used to quell protests in the Fall of 2019), but this has not been used in relation to Covid-19. Instead, the government imposed a number of measures between January and March that were based on existing statutes, and the on March 27 issued new regulation under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. On March 27, Hong Kong authorities announced a new regulation called 599G Regulation that controls freedom of assembly, where they can ban any public gatherings over four people (it was subsequently amended to two people, but seem to be back at four people at the moment) under a specified period of no more than 14 days. Within this legislation, authorities are also given extended powers such as entering places without warrants. This is here regarded as the main legal instrument in the emergency response, and is new legislation taken under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, and this is therefore coded as 4.

# India 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 India has not declared a state of emergency. Instead on 24 March 2020, the central government invoked the National Disaster Management Act. It has declared Covid-19 to be a disaster within Section 10 of the NDMA. This authorizes the National Disaster Management Authority to issue binding directions and guidelines to the several state governments, for the purposes of addressing a disaster. It centralizes the sphere of operations, giving the federal government overriding powers of enforcement.

# Ireland 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Ireland has an emergency legislation, but it only allows for declaring states of emergency "in time of war or armed rebellion". The Irish government and parliament thus made a substantial amendment to the existing Health Act (the amendment is called Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) which gives the Minister of Health power to restrict gatherings, implement lockdowns, travel restrictions and the like. The main national level emergency response has thus been taken under this legal instrument, which is a new amendment, and therefore coded as 4.

# Israel 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The Israeli Prime Minister declared a state of emergency on March 19, based on Article 38 and 39 in the constitution. This is therefore coded as 1, a state of emergency within existing legal framework.
Note that Israel passed a new law on July 21 called the "Major Corona Law", that gives government extended powers during a state of emergency as well as allowing them to declare it for 60 days instead of 7 days. The initial state of emergency and extensions of it were taken under the articles mentioned above, but the current are taken under this new Major Corona Law. Most recently, it was extended from September 7 to November 6.

# Italy 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 A State of Emergency was declared by the Italian Government on 31 January, with reference to the Legislative Decree No. 1 of 2 January 2018. This is thus not a constitutional state of emergency, but one taken with under regular legislation.
Note that a number of decrees also have been issued after this to perform a number of emergency measures, but the initial emergency response is this declaration of a state of emergency. In late July, the State of Emergency was extended to October 15.

# Kenya 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 'The Kenyan Public Health Act (1) is the primary legislation applicable to matters of public health crises, authorizes public health authorities, particularly the Minister of Health, to take various actions during public health crises, including declaring an infectious disease a “notifiable infectious disease” or a “formidable epidemic, endemic or infectious disease,” and taking the necessary prevention and suppression measures to fight the disease.  Specific powers accorded to health authorities for the purpose of prevention and suppression of an infectious disease include search, seizure, and detention powers; the power to designate any place as a quarantine area, including ships and aircraft; and the power to restrict or ban immigration into the country.'' (2)

Kenyan authorities (MUTAHI KAGWE, the Cabinet Secretary for Health) declared on the Government Gazzette on March 2, 2020 (3):
(a) the coronavirus 2019 disease as a notifiable disease for the purposes of section 17 (1) of the Public Health Act, and 
(b) that the provisions of Part IV of the Public Health Act shall apply with respect to the  prevention, control  and  suppression of  the  coronavirus 2019 disease.
This allowed the government to take the necessary measures in order to deal with the covid19 pandemic the same way as other formidable or notifiable diseases that are already included in the Act.

The first activation of the Public Health Act (Sections 35 and 36) to deal with the pandemic occurred on April 3, 2020, with LEGAL NOTICE No . 49 - 
THE PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION, CONTROL AND SUPPRESSION OF COVID-19) RULES, 2020  (4), which has been updated ever since a few times (for the full list of legislation, see 8).

Before that, the Public Order Act (2003) (9) was activated, now the Public Order (State Curfew) Order 2020, effected by Legal Notice No. 36 of the Kenya Gazette Notice of 26th March 2020, was issued, imposing the countrywide curfew in Kenya, which was the strictest measure compared to the ones issued previously. (10).

Before March 26, a few other more general measures and guidlines had been issued (see 5, 6, 7).

# Kuwait 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 Kuwait has issued a number of measures (e.g. curfews, closing of schools and workplaces, restricting religious gatherings), with many of these starting on March 12. But there is no mention of any state of emergency having been declared, or any legal instrument being referred to when implementing these measures. Garda and the U.S. Embassy for example makes no mention of any such state of emergency, and ACAPS who records all policies taken during the crisis has no mentioning of declaring of a state of emergency. Therefore, this is coded as 5 as there is a national level emergency response, but no legal instrument or declared state of emergency.

# Kyrgyzstan 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 On 22 March, the Kyrgyz Security Council  declared emergency situation regime in the whole country (Decision 93 from 22 March 2020). On 24 March, the President declared a state of emergency in the cities of Bishkek, Osh, Jalal-Abad and the Nookat and Kara-Suu districts of the Osh region and the Suzak district of the Jalal-Abad region from 25 March.

Note that although other sources refer to the emergency regime in the whole country as "state of emergency" (ICNL, International IDEA), here it is coded as emergency situation regime ( Art. 2 (4) ("chrezvychaynaya situatsiya") of the Law on Civil Protection from 24 May 2018)) and not as state of emergency (Constitutional law on states of emergency)

# Laos 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister issued a decree that specifies and regulates the main emergency measures in Laos, for example public gatherings, public transport, border closure etc. This is not taken in reference to any state of emergency or existing regulations, and is thus regarded as adopting a new law. Therefore, this is coded as 4.

# Lebanon 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Lebanon declared a state of emergency on March 16, according to several sources. Sources like  Garda, UNDP, ACAPS and Human Rights Watch regard it a state of emergency rather than a public health emergency or state of disaster. Furthermore, ACAPS state that: "The Government invoked Article 2 of 1983 National Defense Law, which stipulates that the Government may declare general mobilization when a threat is endangering the population.".
Consequently, this  is coded as a state of emergency within existing legal framework.

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Lesotho declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic retrospectively on March 28, 2020, to be in force from March 18, and then again on April 15, 2020. He had, in the meantime, prorogued the Parliament on March 19. 

It is a bit unlcear what was the situation between the two declarations of state of emergency: 

''...on Friday 27 March 2020, the Prime Minister pursuant to s 23(1) of the Constitution retrospectively declared a state of emergency from 18 March 2020. As shown above, since s 23(2) of the Constitution prescribes that a declaration of state of emergency automatically lapses at the expiration of 14 days from the date on which it was declared. It means that the state of emergency automatically lapsed on 8 April 2020 unless extended by Parliament....Lesotho is not the only country in the region that confers powers to the head of the executive to declare a state of emergency without parliamentary approval.''

''As alluded to earlier, the Prime Minister has the power to declare the state of emergency without the approval of Parliament. However, only Parliament has the power to extend such a declaration from the initial 14 days. The problem in Lesotho is that the state of emergency was declared at a time when Parliament was prorogued. This means that there was no constitutional authority to extend the state of emergency beyond the 14 days that the Prime Minister is allowed to establish. Realizing this constitutional reality, on 15 April 2020, the Prime Minister re-declared the state of emergency from 15 April 2020 to 28 April 2020. Whilst this was legally correct under those circumstances, it does raise questions about the legal position that persisted between 8 April and 15 April 2020. Was there a state of emergency during this period? Were the things done or enforced during this period constitutionally sanctioned? The answers to some of these or other questions remain unclear and may never be found.''

Constitution (1993), section 23 (1).
23. Declaration of emergency - 1. In time of war or other public emergency which threatens the life of the nation, the Prime Minister may, acting in accordance with the advice of the Council of State, by proclamation which shall be published in the Gazette, declare that a state of emergency exists for the purposes of this Chapter.

''In addition to s 23 of Constitution, Parliament has enacted statutes that enable the state to implement a state of emergency situations. Among these statutes is the Emergency Powers Act of 1988 and the Disaster Management Act 2 of 1997. Section 23 of the Constitution is read and implemented together with the Emergency Powers Act and the Disaster Management Act.''

# Lithuania 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Government Resolution No 207 declaring quarantine on the territory of the Republic of Lithuania ‘Dėl karantino Lietuvos Respublikos teritorijoje paskelbimo’ from 16 March 2020.

The authorities have also announced state-level emergency from 26 February (Resolution 152 ‘On Declaration of State-Level Emergency (Dėl valstybės lygio ekstremalios situacijos paskelbimo‘), which is still in place at the time of coding. Note that state-level emergency ("ekstremaliajai situacijai", Law on Civil Protection, Art 2 (1)) is different from state of emergency ("nepaprastąją padėtį", Art 144 of the Constitution). According to OSCE report (p.25-26, 31-32), Lithuania is among countries that "declared some forms of special public-health related status, not amounting to a "state of emergency", based on existing or newly adopted primary legislation, and not on the constitution" where the legal instrument is considered to be quarantine.

# Malaysia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Malaysia has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 150), but this has not been used. Instead, the government has issued emergency measures and regulations under The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988, which puts the Minister of Health in charge and allows him/her to issue regulations. The most significant such regulation instituted under this law is the Movement Control Order, which was put in effect on March 20 and regulates freedom of movement, association, closing of public places, bussiness and borders, and the like. As these are new regulations enacted by the government through an existing legal instrument, this is coded as 4. 
The Movement Control Order was extended on August 28 and is set to end at December 31. This new legislation eases some of the restrictions, and is called a recovery movement control order, but still keeps a lot of the restrictions in place.

# Mali 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 "In addition to the state of emergency which prevails in our country due to the security context, the state of health emergency is decreed. A curfew is also decreed. It will be rigorously applied from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., until further notice, starting at midnight on Thursday, March 26, 2020, " President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita (2)

The state of (health) emergency was issued based on:
Constitution, articles 49, 50, 72, 74; (1)
accompanied by law 2017 055 of November 6, 2017 on the state of emergency and state of siege (3)

Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if they allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

# Mauritania 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 In Mauritania, the government in mid-March 2020, took various gradual measures without a reference to a specific legal instrument, which were announced through Press Releases (Communiqués) (see list of all measures (3)). These measures included the suspension of all events and demonstrations, restriction of border crossings (March 15), a night curfew (March 18), prohibition of all road traffic and movement of persons between the wilayas (regions) as of Sunday, March 29 at 12:00 noon, except for health workers, service delivery missions (e.g., water, electricity, telecommunications) and the transportation of goods (March 28).

On April 1, 2020, the Council of Ministers invoked article 60 of the Constitution (1991) (1), which gives special powers to the government for a limited period of time: (2)

''Article 60 -After the agreement of the President of the Republic, the Government can, for the execution of its program, demand of the Parliament the authorization of taking by ordinance, for a limited period, the measures that are normally of the domain of the law. These ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers and require the approval of the President of the Republic[,] who signs them. They enter into force as soon as they are published, but they become lapsed if the Bill of the law of ratification is not deposited before [devant] the Parliament before [avant] the date established by the enabling law. At the expiration of the time mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article, the ordinances cannot be modified[,] except by the law[,] in the matters that are of the legislative domain. The enabling law lapses if the National Assembly is dissolved.''

''Council of Ministers: Approval of a bill authorizing the Government to take all the measures necessary to fight against the Covid pandemic19. - Nouakchott, 04/01/2020
The Council under the Chairmanship of His Excellency Mohamed Ould Cheikh El-Ghazouani, President of the Republic, examined and approved a draft enabling law authorizing the Government, in application of article 60 of the Constitution, to take by ordinances during a limited time, all the necessary measures, which are normally of the domain of the law, to fight the Covid pandemic19. 
This bill is part of the actions initiated by the Government to protect our populations against the spread of Covid19 which is wreaking havoc in several countries of the world.
It will consolidate the efforts undertaken since the onset of this exceptional and unprecedented pandemic, by giving the Government the flexibility and the related legal instruments to act with the required speed and in a timely manner.''

# Mongolia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The Mongolian constitution has a state of emergency clause that has not been used. Instead, Mongolia initially took a string of emergency measures (border closure, school closure etc.) without any such state of emergency, and have later passed the Law on Covid-19 Prevention. This law authorizes the government to "take necessary measures, such as calling quarantine and traffic movement and time limits, as well as approving relevant regimes, procedures, and instructions to be followed during the COVID 19 pandemic.". This is therefore coded as 4.

# Mozambique 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 According to the constitution, a state of emergency can be declared for up to thirty days a time and it can be extended a maximum of three times. Due to covid-19, a SoE was first declared on March 30, via the Presidential Decree nº 11/2020, and it was extended three times, until July 29. Then, President Filipe Nyus opted to declare a new SoE for thirty days starting from August 8, via the Presidential Decree nº 23/2020. The parliament approved the decree, but the opposition criticized the decision, which they considered unconstitutional since the SoE had already been extended the three times allowed by the constitution.

# Nepal 
*Answer*: 7 

*Comments*:
 Nepal never went into a state of emergency. The relevant legal document in this case has been the Infectious Disease Control Act 1964. Section 2(1) of the Act enables the Government of Nepal to take necessary action and issue necessary orders applicable to the general public or a group of any persons to root out or prevent the development or spread of an infectious disease.

The Act is rather broad. Section 2(1) can, in theory, provide legal foundation for any government action taken to tackle COVID-19 both moderate and extraordinary.

# Netherlands 
*Answer*: 6 

*Comments*:
 The Netherlands has a State of Emergency Act in their constitution (Article 103), but this has not been used. Instead, they have used a mixed set of policies and legal instruments to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. The main emergency measures have been taken under the Safety Regions Act (Wet Veiligheidregions), which allows 25 "safety regions" to enforce a number of emergency measures given that the there's a significant public health threat, which in turn is regulated in the  Public Health Act. 
While the government coordinates a substantial amount of the emergency responses (the measures taken by the regions is more or less identical), the implementation and decision making lies at the regional level. Therefore, this is coded as 6 - no national-level emergency response - since the main legal instrument puts decision making and implementation at the regional level.

# Niger 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Niger declared a nationwide state of emergency through a decree. 
Although in some sources it is mentioned as a State of Public Health Emergency, and the President himself described it in a speech as such, in most official government sources it is described as a State of Emergency. 
Also, the constitution does not differentiate between a state of emergency and a state of health emergency, but instead has provisions only for a state of emergency (therefore coded as 1).

# Nigeria 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Nigeria has called upon emergency powers to deal with COVID-19 without, however, having declared a state of emergency. The extant Infectious Diseases Law ‚Äì the Quarantine Act 1926 ‚Äì gives the President sweeping powers towards preventing the introduction into and spread in Nigeria, and the transmission from Nigeria, of dangerous infectious diseases‚Äù and to make regulations for associated purposes.

# North Korea 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 A state of emergency was declared on 30 January 2020 and the anti-epidemic headquarters was established around the country. It's borders were shut in late January and quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month. 

North Korea claimed that it has not had a single case of Covid-19. While this is highly unlikely, there hasn't been a need for additional emergency responses. 

A three-week lockdown was imposed in the city of Kaesong in July 2020 after a suspected case of Coid-19. No information was released to say if it had been a confirmed case of a false alarm.

# North Macedonia 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The government declared a state of emergency on 18 March, initially for 30 days (Decision 08-526/2). On 15 May, it was extended by 14 days (Decision 08-682/2). It was then extended by another 14 days on 30 May (Decision 08-729/2), and ended on 13 June. On 15 June, the state of emergency was declared for 8 days to prepare for parliamentary elections (Decision 08-777/3). According to Decision 08-777/3, the state of emergency is declared for holding parliamentary elections with public health measures due to covid-19; since it is declared with reference to covid-19, it is considered part of emergency measures.

 Norway passed a new law, the Corona Act, on 24 March, which "gives the King (i.e. the Government) the authority to add to or depart from certain legislation as far as is necessary to safeguard the intention of the law. " In other words, no state of emergency has been declared, but national emergency measures are being taken under the Corona Act. Therefore, this is coded as 4.

# Panama 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 There were several emergency measures taken by the government in response to the covid-19 pandemic. The Resolución de Gabinete N° 11 declared a state of national emergency on March 13. However, it is not based on the constitution, that forsees a "state of urgency" in which the government could suspend constitutional guarantees. Rather, it is based on the public procurement law, which facilitated the purchase of good and services to deal with an emergency situation and provides the government with an emergency fund. Thus, I consider that the measure that most closely resembles a state of exception was the Executive Decree nº 507, from March 24, that declares a complete lockdown.

The government also declared state of emergency (Law 6524 from March 26) for budgetary and fiscal reasons, but the state of public health emergency establishes measures that most resemble a state of exception.

# Philippines 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 A national state of calamity was declared across the Philippines on 16 March 2020. This stays in effect for six months. On 23 March 2020, President Duterte enacted the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. This "authorizes the president to exercise powers necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet the current national emergency related to Covid-19 only for three months unless extended by Congress. The act would allow President Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost 275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated 438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic; enable him to "temporarily take over or direct the operations" of public utilities and privately owned health facilities and other necessary facilities "when the public interest so requires" for quarantine, the accommodation of health professionals, and the distribution and storage of medical relief; and "facilitate and streamline" the accreditation of testing kits. 

2: A COVID-19 law that went into effect on March 24 grants the administration broad powers to address the coronavirus, which has contributed to violations of human rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression, access to information, and children's rights.

# Republic of the Congo 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The government of the Republic of the Congo declared a "state of health emergency" on March 28th (to enter into force from March 31) 2020 through a presidential decree. 

Constitution (2015), articles 93, 157 (provisions on state of emergency). Coded as 1 instrad of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency,despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if the allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. ''state of siege'') as warranted.

# Russia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 A presidential decree to order a period of non-working days (English translation taken from https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/05/21/russias-covid-19-outbreak-is-far-worse-than-the-kremlin-admits). The first period of non-working days was declared from 30 March until 3 April (Decree 206 from 25 March 2020). It was then extended from 4 April until 30 April (Decree 239 from 2 April 2020). The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May, and ended on 11 May, as announced by President Putin.

Since most emergency measures were taken at the regional level, the measures that most resemble a "state of exception" were taken at the regional and not federal level. For example, a state of high alert was announced by all Russia's regions (see references to regional decisions on consultant.ru source), so it was de facto declared in the whole country, but not on a federal level (and therefore is not coded).

# Rwanda 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 Rwandan government took several measures to deal with the pandemic, but these were not based on a specific legal instrument.
''In early March a taskforce was assembled and guidelines were issued on 6 March on social distancing and handwashing, and hand sanitiser was placed outside all major public buildings and shopping centres. Testing began well before the first COVID-19 case, which was verified on 14 March.''

# Saudi Arabia 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 The Saudi government have taken many emergency measures, such as curfews, lockdowns of some areas and regions, travel bans, border closure and closing of religious and public places.
However, this has been without any declared state of emergency, and there's no reference to specific legal instruments under which these actions are taken in the source, nor that they have adopted any new laws. This lack of legal instrument has also remained in the second period.
This is therefore coded as 5.

# Serbia 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 A presidential decree 1186/2020, published in Official Gazette 29, declaring a state of emergency from 15 March 2020. 

On 7 July, the President announced "as of tomorrow all public gatherings in Belgrade will be banned and that a curfew will be introduced from Friday until Monday", which he later announced would not be possible without declaring another state of emergency. The announcement triggered large anti-lockdown protests, and the measures were not implemented. On 17 July, new restrictive measures were introduced (prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people, making wearing masks and practicing physical distancing mandatory).

# Slovakia 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 State of emergency ("Núdzový stav") declared on 16 March by the government (Order 114/2020) on the basis of Art. 5 of the Constitutional Law No. 227/2002. Constitutional Law No. 227/2002 distinguishes between two types of states of emergency:  "Núdzový stav" (Art.5, includes pandemics) and "Výnimočný stav" (Art 4, only in response to terrorism or widespread violence).  

Note that most sources (media, ICNL) refer to the measures as "state of emergency", with the exception of OSCE report that refers to the measures as "emergency situation."  Using "emergency situation" to refer to the state of emergency (declared from 16 March until 13 June 2020) can be problematic. "Emergency situation" ("Mimoriadna situácia") (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights refers to it as "the state of crisis") was declared from 12 March 2020 based on "Zákon Národnej rady Slovenskej republiky o civilnej ochrane obyvateľstva" (paragraph 8) and has continued after the state of emergency ("Núdzový stav").

# Slovenia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The main emergency measures were declared under the Communicable Diseases Act Declaration (Zakon o nalezljivih boleznih (ZNB)). Part of the measures was a declaration of "epidemic" from 12 March 2020 until 15 May 2020. According to OSCE report (p.26), Slovenia (among other countries) "declared some form of special public-health related status, not amounting to a "state of emergency", based on existing or newly adopted primary legislation, and not the constitution" (in this case, it is existing legislation).

According to European Union Agency for Fundamenal Rights, "On 12 March 2020, because of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases, Slovenia declared the Covid-19 epidemic on the basis of the Communicable Diseases Act (Zakon o nalezljivih boleznih).This legislation has been the legal basis for introducing different measures, including measures restricting social interactions in the country in the subsequent period."

*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The government proposed an amendment to the Comunicable Disease Act (Temporary authorisations in the Communicable Diseases Act due to the virus causing covid-19) that parliament passed, which allows the government to impose temporary restrictions on gatherings and temporary closing of schools, business, public places and transport. This is thus a new regulation that gives government capacity for some emergency measures related to Covid-19, and is therefore coded as 4.

*Comments*:
 Switzerland has adopted new regulation (Ordinance 1 and 2 on measures to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19)). The first was imposed on February 28, and the second on March 13. It is the second regulation that is here considered the main legal instrument, as it allowed farther reaching emergency measures and the one under which the main response such as closing of shools and public places and curfews were taken.
The regulations enacted are based in the Epidemics Act and the Swiss Constitution, but is a new legislation and is therefore coded as 4.

# Taiwan 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Taiwan never went into a state of emergency.

The Special Act for Prevention, Relief and Revitalization Measures for Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens was passed in Taiwan's legislative Yuan on 25 Feb 2020. It authorizes government expenditure on relief compensation and economic stimulus in fighting the current Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to providing economic relief, the Special Act prescribes penalties for price gouging, carriers or suspected carriers endangering others, misinformation and violation of isolation or quarantine orders during the coronavirus pandemic.

At the same time, most of the government's actions have been authorized under the previously adopted legislation in particular the Communicable Disease Control Act 
and the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act, rather than the Special Act. Hence, this has been coded as 2.

# Togo 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The president of Togo declared a three-month nationwide "health emergency,"on April 1, and a six-month period of exceptional lawmaking authority under Article 86 (and 94) of the Constitution. (1)
Before the president's declaration, on March 30, 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus in his address to the Nation of April 1, 2020, the Head of State decreed a state of health emergency, which will be sanctioned by the April 2020 Ordinance determining the conditions of implementation of the state of emergency in Togo, itself ratified by decree N ° 2020-024 declaring a state of health emergency.

Yet, although the provisions of article 86 of the constitution provide that “the law fixes the rules concerning (…) the state of siege and the state emergency ”crossed with those of article 94 according to which“ organic law determines the conditions of implementation of the state of siege or the state of emergency , according to critics (see source 5, 6), ''the organic law is otherwise non-existent, at least not found.''
Also, the same critics (mainly ssee link 6), question the legitimacy of the state of emergency in Togo, despite the constitution having such provisions, and despite the president citing the respective articles of the Constitution:

''As a reminder, the National Assembly adopted on March 27, in accordance with article 86 of the Constitution, a law empowering the Government to take, for a period of six months, measures within the domain of the law to combat spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and protect the population from the risks of contamination. In his address to the nation on 1 st April, the head of state declared a public health emergency for a period of three months. However, the publication of the decree on the state of emergency is still desired. The consequence is that since the speech of the Head of State, Togo is under a de facto state of emergency.
...''These measures, which, moreover, are taken in simple press releases, have no legal basis. This results in a lot of confusion and a lack of coherence and coordination in the measures taken....''
''Article 94 paragraph 5 of the Constitution provides that " an organic law determines the conditions for implementing the state of siege and the state of emergencymore than necessary to find a legal basis for the measures likely to be taken. To do this, and in the face of the emergency, the Government took advantage of the enabling law of March 30 to define the legal framework for the state of emergency by ordinance.''

Coded as 1 instread of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if it allows for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

# Turkey 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The Turkish constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), but such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued decrees with reference to ordinary laws -- Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies.

Among many reports that express concern about the situation (see links to Human Rights Watch articles), the U.S. embassy issued the following alert : “While there are no official reports of positive COVID-19 cases in Turkmenistan, the U.S. Embassy has received reports of local citizens with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 undergoing COVID-19 testing and being placed in quarantine in infectious diseases hospitals for up to fourteen days”, which was dismissed by the authorities as "fake news" (Reuters 23 June 2020).  On 13 July 2020, the authorities issues orders to wear face masks because of high concentration of dust in the air (as reported in state media). According to Garda, "the government has also advised individuals to use personal protective equipment (PPE), to maintain a social distance of at least 1m (3ft) apart when in public, and to avoid standing near air conditioners after spending time outside." According to OECD, the emergency measures in Turkmenistan are "Closure of borders, Restrictions on internal movements of people and goods". According to OSCE report (p. 26), the emergency measures are "screening and quarantine measures, temporary closure of passenger traffic, physical distancing, closure of cafes, restaurants and entertainment centers".

# Uganda 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Reasons to declare a state of emergency (Section 110 in constitution) do not include disease. 
Therefore, the "Public Health Act of Uganda (Cap 281, 2000)", is the main instrument used to make the rules in "The Public Health (Control of COVID - 19) Rules, 2020."

# United Kingdom 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The UK governmet has enacted two new sets of regulations, the The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions)  Regulations 2020, and the Coronavirus Act. Both enable several emergency measures related to Covid-19. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) is here counted as the main legislation, as it provides the main limitations on freedom of movement, gathering and the closing of public places and business. Noteworthy is also that there are four separate such regulations for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but the regulations are very similar and provides the same emergency measures capacity across the UK.
This is a new law, and not a state of emergency declaration, and is therefore coded as 4.
Note that The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020 was repealed on July 3 and replaced with The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) Regulations 2020, which relaxed some emergency measures. It is still the initial one that counts as the primary legal instrument here, which has ended, but there is thus still emergency legislation in place in the UK.

 The US government made a declaration under the National Emergency Act, stating that "the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency". Consequently, this is regarded a declaration of state of emergency, within the existing legal framework.

# Uzbekistan 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 On 29 January, the President issued order 5537 on creation of an anti-crisis commission. The government passed several decrees with emergency measures but mostly the measures have been announced by the anti-crisis commission (e.g. on its website and Telegram channel "Koronavirus Info | Uyda Qoling!") or the President. Legislation included decree 176 from 23 March 2020 (stopping some business activities, prohibiting all public events, closing access to the capital for everyone excluding its permanent residents). Previously, the government passed decree 5969 from 19 March 2020 on economic measures.

Among the most strict measures, a lockdown was declared in the capital Tashkent from 24 March, that was extended to several other cities from 1 April (people were only allowed to leave their homes to go to work or visit shops for buying food/medicine). The measures were announced until 20 April, were then extended until 10 May. Since early May, restrictions were eased. Due to an increase in Covid-19 cases, a second lockdown (less severe than the first) was in place from 10 July until 15 August.

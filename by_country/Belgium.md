## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or theg overnment has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  seeAgamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Belgium invoke Article 1d05 of the Constitution that gives Special powers to the executive in order to pass legislation dealing with Covid19 (1; 2; 3).
Based on the above, two covid19 laws were passed: Article 3 of Law COVID-19 (I) (No 1104/5), and Article 5 of Law COVID-19 (II) (No 1104/6). 
However, before these two main legal instruments there were a series of laws for the first measures: On 13 March, a ministerial decree signed by the Interior Minister prohibited a number of cultural, recreational and sporting activities, while also closing down schools and restaurants, inter alia. Stricter measures were introduced by ministerial decrees on 18 March and 23 March (including social distancing, distance learning and teleworking for non-essential business); these were further clarified on 24 March and modified on 17 April.

*Comments*:
 Belgium began phasing out lockdown measures at the beginning of May. There have been several key dates when measures were being gradually relaxed, but many of them there are still in place:

''Belgium's next phase of lockdown relaxation will not start as foreseen on August 1 given the current state of the coronavirus pandemic.''
''So-called Phase 5 included allowing a higher number of people to take part in events held indoor and outdoors. Currently, civil marriage ceremonies, religious gatherings and funerals for up to 200 attendees are allowed, while the limit for participation at private indoor receptions is 50 people. Outdoor events for up to 400 people are also permitted.''

28 August 2020: The Belgian government, with a nod to European Commission recommendations, is adjusting its border restrictions as it assesses the evolving COVID-19 situation in countries around the world, and is alternatively leaving certain restrictions in place and putting measures/conditions in place to allow for travel by certain categories of travellers. The government has agreed to gradually resume visa operations and activities in Belgian Embassies and Consulates abroad to facilitate certain visa applications.''

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in 	extit{emlaw}. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1). 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes.

 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 'Under the special powers provision, decrees need to be confirmed by law within a set deadline. In the specific case of a pandemic, the decrees need to be converted within a year of their entry into force. In the absence of such confirmation they will become void. Moreover, in the contest of the coronavirus pandemic, the House of Representatives has created a new parliamentary committee devoted specifically to requesting information from, and overseeing, the members of the federal government with regard to measures taken under the 'special powers' provision.'' (1)

According to article 105 of the Belgian Constitution (special powers decrees), ''the legislator authorises the Government (formally the King at federal level) to abrogate, complete, modify or replace legislative act through royal decrees, under some conditions. The special powers act adopted under exceptional circumstances determine the rationae materiae scope of the measures that can be taken and is always time-limited. The special powers royal decrees have to be confirmed by an act of the legislator within one year of them coming into effect – which is usually a very formal procedure, even if the minority government makes it slightly less certain in this case –, otherwise they will be considered as never having produced effect. Once they are confirmed, they are considered as legislative acts.'' (2)

The measures adopted by the King can have a retroactive effect to the 1st March, 2020. So far, the federal government has adopted (and published) five Special Powers Decrees (....).... 
The draft proposal explains that the government has to keep the Chamber of Representatives informed about the measures it takes in virtue of its special powers. However, this obligation was not formalised in the final act.'' (2)

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the time period, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No,Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the health system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19.

 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The House of Representatives only maintains its essential meetings, which are subject to compliance with social distancing measures. The debate in plenary on Thursday March 26 was therefore reserved for group leaders, accompanied by one member from each group). 
The regional parliaments followed different procedures but also held elections, although with social distancing measures.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (	extit{leglimit}!=4).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 'On 17 March 2020, even before the federal parliament did, the parliament of the Walloon Region granted sweeping special powers.''...the Walloon parliament even granted powers in case it would be adjourned because of COVID 19....On 17 March 2020, the parliament of the French Community too adopted special powers legislation, although these were more limited with regard to their object and focused on education measures. On 19 March 2020, the parliamentary institutions in Brussels-Capital followed suit, granting special powers with regard to virtually all areas of regional and community competences and which are impacted by the crisis. In Flanders, no special powers have been granted so far. On 18 March 2020, the Flemish parliament itself adopted emergency measures with regard to urban planning requirements, anticipating the short-term construction of hospitals and other care facilities.'' There is subnational variation in certain measures and dates when these measures were adopted, based on each Province and Region.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 There have been reports on racial profiling in Belgium with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures.

 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and to date two people from racialised groups have died at the hands of the police, in France and in Belgium. (Adil C., 19 years old, who died on 10 April 2020 in Belgium.)'' (1, 3, 5)
''incidents of disproportionate policing of Romani people and Travellers have also cropped up in Belgium, where an armed response team evicted families, including a pregnant woman and children, from their caravans''. (2)
''The media and NGOs reported the disproportionate impact of the enforcement of lockdown measures on working class neighbourhoods, home to a large minority ethnic community.
 The Human Rights League collected allegations of abusive police practices between 18 March and 29 May. In 36% of the cases police allegedly use the force unlawfully, in 21% of the cases they uttered insults. Forty per cent of the victims were racialized people.'' (5, 7)

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

 No, although there are allegations for violation of the right to freedom of expression - From Amnesty Intl's report on policing the pandemic:

''Following Adil’s death, protests took place during which acts of violence were committed. However, many people also peacefully demanded accountability for the death. The Human Rights League has reported at
least 10 cases in which police ordered people to remove banners calling for “Justice for Adil” in the days after his death. The banners were hung on windows or the external facades of houses. Police told the press that local police regulations prohibit the display of banners on external facades. The order to remove the banners constitutes an unnecessary and arbitrary restriction of the right to freedom of expression.''

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 There have been several reports on police violence in Belgium with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures during the March-June 2020 period. 

 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and to date two people from racialised groups have died at the hands of the police, in France and in Belgium. (Adil C., 19 years old, who died on 10 April 2020 in Belgium.)'' (1, 3, 5)
''incidents of disproportionate policing of Romani people and Travellers have also cropped up in Belgium, where an armed response team evicted families, including a pregnant woman and children, from their caravans''. (2)
''The media and NGOs reported the disproportionate impact of the enforcement of lockdown measures on working class neighbourhoods, home to a large minority ethnic community.
 The Human Rights League collected allegations of abusive police practices between 18 March and 29 May. In 36% of the cases police allegedly use the force unlawfully, in 21% of the cases they uttered insults. Forty per cent of the victims were racialized people.'' (5, 7)

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: ``Confinement measures'' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

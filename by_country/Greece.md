## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or theg overnment has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  seeAgamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The greek Constitution (1) has provisions for giving extraordinary powers to the executive in emergency situations other than war (art 44). To deal with the pandemic, the greek government invoked art 44 of the Constitution, which gives the executive the power to ''fast-track'' law-making, through the so-called ''Acts of Legislative Content''. These Acts need parliamentary approval after their issuance, and are usually accompanied by the so-called ''Common Ministerial Decisions'' (KYA in greek), which are government decisions that specify in more detail the general measures taken with the Acts.

## Emergency response name (*emname*) 

*Question*: What is the specific name of the legal instrument that the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers  to  the  legal  instrument  defined  in emlaw.   This  may  be  the Constitution,  law,  executive  order,  or  other  legal  mechanism.  Give  the  specific  proper name of the law as it is known in the country.  This can be in the country’s language or a translation if such is readily used and available. If the legal instrument is the Constitution, also provide the Article or section number wherever possible.

 

*Scale*: Character string.

 
*Answer*: Constitution, art 44, ''Act of Legislative order'' (1)
1. Under extraordinary circumstances of an urgent and unforeseeable need, the President of the Republic may, upon the proposal of the Cabinet, issue acts of legislative content. Such acts shall be submitted to Parliament for ratification, as specified in the provisions of article 72 paragraph 1, within forty days of their issuance or within forty days from the convocation of a parliamentary session. Should such acts not be submitted to Parliament within the above time-limits or if they should not be ratified by Parliament within three months of their submission, they will henceforth cease to be in force. 

*Comments*:
 There have been several Legislative Acts containing different sets of measures in regards to the coronavirus pandemic, and all are taken based on the same legal instrument (see all listed measures in (2))
The main (strictest) measures (lockdown) are included in the Act  ''ΚΥΑ 20036'' (Common Ministerial Decision 20036), 22.03.2020, Government Gazette no 986, titled ''Επιβολή του μέτρου του προσωρινού περιορισμού της κυκλοφορίας των πολιτών προς αντιμετώπιση του κινδύνου διασποράς του κορωνοϊού COVID-19.'' (Imposition of the temporary movement restriction measure against the spread of covid19'') (3)

*Comments*:
 The strictest measure, i.e. the lockdown, has been lifted since May 5, 2020. However, the greek government has continued using art 44 of the Constitution as a legal instrument to deal with the pandemic and pass legislation.
For instance, in late July (31) and August 2020, more measures were taken to deal with the second wave. These measures are both nationwide - mandatory wearing of masks in enclosed spaces-, but also local, for areas with high number of covid19 cases such as Athens, Thessaloniki, and several islands.

 1. Yes.

 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 As required by the Constitution, all Legislative Acts with measures against covid19 were, after their issuance, voted in the Parliament. The lockdown decision was part of a group of measures that were approved with a Legislative Act, but its specific content and details were issued through a Ministerial Decision (KYΑ Δ1 α/Γ.Π οικ 20036/2020 - ΦΕΚ 986/Β/22-3-2020) (4) , which technically does not need (nor took) parliamentary approval, but it requires authorization by being published on the Government Gazette.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the time period, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No,Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the health system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19.

 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The greek government throughout the pandemic has been taking decisions and issuing laws based on art 44 of the Constitution, which gives extra powers to the executive for ''fast-track'' law-making, through the so-called ''Acts of Legislative Content''. These Acts need parliamentary approval after their issuance, and are usually accompanied by ''(Common) Ministerial Decisions'' (KYA in greek), which are government decisions that specify in more detail the general measures taken with the Acts.

The Legislature continues working as normal, but with fewer sessions and fewer MPs present. The parliamentary oversight is still in place and functioning. ''Plenary: Reduced quorum, Committee: Limited to urgent matters, Voting mechanism: Ballot paper, Staff: Non-essential are working remotely.Used procedure of 'organized debate'. Committees can conduct meetings physically or remotely.'' (1, 2)Also, the Greek Parliament decided to only vote on one draft bill per week, with priority given to bills related to the management of the coronavirus outbreak. (3)However, the government has been criticized  of eroding parliamentary scrutiny in the midst of the pandemic (6), mainly for having launched several non-covid19 related laws, many of which quite important (environmental bills, education), with fast-track processes.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The lockdown, but also other measures such as the closing of all non-essential services, applied countrywide. Some different measures were applied locally in relation with covid19 cases' distribution.
In late July (31) and August 2020, more measures were taken to deal with the second wave of the pandemic. These measures are both nationwide - mandatory wearing of masks in enclosed spaces, but also local, for places with high number of covid19 cases such as Athens, Thessaloniki, and several islands.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

The Greek government, alongside the nationwide lockdown it imposed to deal with the pandemic, it also imposed movement restrictions of asylum-seekers in refugee camps in the Aegean islands in April and extended it continuously, without any virological basis, i.e. without any covid19 case having been found (2). The first covid19 case in Moria camp in Lesvos was reported in early September, 2020. (8) 
Note that the government had also put two refugee camps in the mainland (Ritsona and Malakasa camp) in lockdown, but this was after covid19 cases were detected. 

In addition, when the nationwide lockdown was lifted on May 4 2020, the government announced that the island camps will continue to be closed until May and then June 21 without offering an explanation on its decision. (1, 4, 5, 6).
''Moria camp has been under lockdown since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and residents are only allowed out of the camp during certain times of the day to see a doctor or to buy food. Only 150 people are allowed to leave the camp per hour. Since the beginning of March, all migrants who reach the island have been placed in quarantine away from residents at Moria.'' (14) 

After the first covid 19 case in Moria, Greek authorities have extended the lockdown of all structures hosting refugees and migrants until 15 September. (13)

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position. 

 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 No de jure media limitations found in the emergency measures.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1.Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

 
Time period: *Mar-Jun*: 1

 
Time period: *Jul-Sep*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Authorities in Greece, after a Greek Ministry of Health's decision on March 23, decided to deny access to health editors during briefings on COVID-19. 

''As of March 23, the Greek Ministry of Health, citing public health safety reasons, has decided to close its doors to health editors on a daily basis from Sotiris Tsiodras' spokesman and Deputy Ministers of Civil Protection and Health. In addition, the journalists were informed that they will have the opportunity to ask one - and only one, although there are three speakers -  question per week, which should be submitted in writing to the Press Office, which will read it on "air", without it ability to clarify or apply pressure in order to respond effectively.'' (1,2,3)

Also, opposition media outlets were excluded from a recent government support package in Greece: 
''Greek newspaper Documento was excluded from a €20 million advertising revenue support package organised by the government in apparent retaliation for its critical coverage and investigative reports in the Prime Minister and his inner circle. When asked why Documento had not been received funding like every other major media outlet in the country, the government spokesman replied that the government did not give funding to outlets threat spread “fake news”.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

 
Time period: *Mar-Jun*: 1

 
Time period: *Jul-Sep*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The government used police forces to enforce social distancing measures. The police resorted in excess use of violence, sending many people to the hospital and arresting quite a few individuals. These incidents took place during the March-June 2020 period. 

''Throughout the lockdown..., cases of police abuse, including violence and pushbacks, were reported across the country.'' 
Reports surfaced about police excessive use of force and ill-treatment against people who gathered in Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city, after the measures had been eased.'' (1)

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: ``Confinement measures'' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
